bq. And, as a user, I wonder "why can't the developers just get their OPML to work with Dave's application?" -- "Robert Scoble":http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2005/09/30.html#a11306

By the way, there is a better (micro) format: "xoxo":http://www.microformats.org/wiki/xoxo.  It uses HTML lists for the format.  Oh, and in one single line of rails, I will convert xoxo to HTML:

<pre><code><%= xoxo_data %></code></pre>

(if you don't get it, there is no conversion necessary).

But, is anyone even using xoxo for this?
