title: minimal ruby blogging engine
---
"Tobi":http://blog.leetsoft.com/ decided to release his minimal blogging engine: "typo":http://typo.leetsoft.com/.  

It's obviously not very feature-rich, but the "source":http://typo.leetsoft.com/trac.cgi/browser/trunk/ definitely has some useful little nuggets.

* "Cache Sweepers using the Observer design pattern":http://typo.leetsoft.com/trac.cgi/file/trunk/app/models/blog_sweeper.rb
* "rxml":http://typo.leetsoft.com/trac.cgi/browser/trunk/app/views/xml/ and "shared":http://typo.leetsoft.com/trac.cgi/browser/trunk/app/views/shared/ templates 
* "tadalist integration":http://typo.leetsoft.com/trac.cgi/file/trunk/app/models/tada.rb
* "Blogger API and MetaWeblog API support":http://typo.leetsoft.com/trac.cgi/file/trunk/app/controllers/backend_controller.rb
