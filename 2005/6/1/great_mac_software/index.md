title: great mac software
---
I've had "Postfix Enabler":http://www.cutedgesystems.com/software/PostfixEnabler/ sitting on my desktop for awhile, just waiting until I _absolutely_ needed ActionMailer support.  Well, I needed it today, so just 5 minutes after registering the software and running it, I had ActionMailer sending out emails from my Ruby on Rails app!  I didn't even have to set any custom server settings for Rails.

Last night, I tried out "SubEthaEdit":http://www.codingmonkeys.de/subethaedit/ with a couple folks.  For anyone that hasn't heard of this, it's a networkable text editor that allows other people to connect and collectively write it.  Very powerful stuff.  It's setup would've been 5 minutes if you take out the firewall configuration steps I had to take.

The Mac OSX System Preferences aren't anything special, until you factor in Spotlight.  I have no clue where anything is at, being used to windows.  I just type a few letters in the search bar, and I'm on my way.  Oh, I wish my WinXP Control Panel had this.

I love great software that just works.  One thing I am noticing though, is I get so lost in these _simple_ mac apps.  They keep the preferences minimal (rather than going with the Windows tendency to throw everything in a super tabbed pref window).  That's what I'm used to, though.
