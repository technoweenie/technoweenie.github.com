title: Is your web application rude?
---
When working on the computer, there's nothing I hate more than my applications being rude to me.  For instance, some web pages with forms to fill out will conveniently select the first form field for you.

That's nice, unless it happens to be a slow loading page, and it decides to select the first field by the time you're halfway through filling it out.  "Cameron Adams":http://www.themaninblue.com/writing/perspective/2005/10/27/ has provided a nifty script that actually _checks_ and only selects the initial field if no fields have been filled out.  This should be in every web developer's toolbox.
