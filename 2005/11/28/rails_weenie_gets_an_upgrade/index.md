title: rails weenie gets an upgrade
---
I've been quiet on the blog front about it, but I've been continually hacking away at it.  "Dan":http://piece.dpiddy.net/ (my old Railsday partner) came onboard to lend a helping hand as well.  Here's a brief rundown of what we've added:

* Page caching out the yin yang.  Once things are cached, the site should be *fast*.
* Ajax logins (more on this later)
* If you run out of points, post a Tip and hopefully others will praise it for points!
* Keep track of what's going on with users or entries with atom feeds.  

Let's get this "Rails Weenie":http://rails.techno-weenie.net/ ecosystem going.  Start asking questions and posting tips!

Here's the stats count if you're curious:

<pre><code>Code LOC: 701
Test LOC: 677
Code to Test Ratio: 1:1.0</code></pre>
