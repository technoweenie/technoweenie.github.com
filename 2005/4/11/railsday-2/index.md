The unofficial "RailsDay":http://www.43things.com/things/view/82899 was saturday, and a some interesting apps were made.  

"All Consuming":http://new.allconsuming.net was remade in Rails by Erik Benson.  It's an awful lot like 43Things, but for media you've read/watched/heard.  

Next is the "search generator":http://www.43things.com/entries/view/43839 by Jeremy Hinegardner.  It's not an application in itself, but a rails generator that adds generic indexing to your models.  He "released v0.3":http://www.hinegardner.org/programming/ruby/SearchGenerator0.3.html today.

By the way, there needs to be a central rails authentication system set up.  I've registered for so many little services, it's ridiculous.  My latest is "Old News":http://oldnewsbaby.com.
