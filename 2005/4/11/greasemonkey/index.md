Allright, I'm sold.  Some fantastic greasemonkey scrips have been popping up.  Simon shows us "Flickr without the Flash":http://simon.incutio.com/archive/2005/04/10/lickr.  Lickr implements Flickr's interface in javascript, which turns out to be _better_ than the current flash interface.  He also points to a script that adds "persistent searches to Gmail":http://persistent.info/archives/2005/03/01/gmail-searches ('Search Folders' for you Outlook users).  Finally, Jon Udell is "tracking memes":http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2005/04/11.html#a1212.  Right now, he's adding a simple bloglines and delicious count to links, showing how hot they are currently.  How about an "Old News":http://www.oldnewsbaby.com tracker?
