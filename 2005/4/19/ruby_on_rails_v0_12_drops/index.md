title: Ruby on Rails v0.12 drops

"Ruby on Rails v0.12":http://weblog.rubyonrails.com/archives/2005/04/18/rails-0120-eager-associations-new-basefind-api-assertions-revisited-more-ajax/ is out now.  Lots of good stuff all around, but of course my favorite is the eager association loading.  Basically, this solves the common n+1 query problem in rails applications without "resorting to ugly hacks":http://techno-weenie.net/blog/code/184/rails-best-practices.  Nice.
