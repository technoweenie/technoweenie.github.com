title: Comiclog is out
---
"comiclog":http://comiclog.com/ is my little comic book database I've been working on for about a month in my spare time.  It's invite-only for now, mostly to keep curious travelers out of it.  It's still pretty rough right now.

This is an idea I've been toying with for some time.  If I need information on movies or anything, there are great resources.  But, there's nothing for comics.  Comic publishers just don't get the web.  It's not just a forum for a bunch of fanboys to get together and bitch about your latest summer blockbuster.  I'm just trying to explore what else the web can do for comics.

Ideas are welcome.  "Bug reports":http://dev.comiclog.com/newticket are also welcome.  My current source code "is available":http://dev.comiclog.com/browser/trunk/.  comiclog is powered by "Ruby on Rails":http://rubyonrails.com / "TextDrive":http://textdrive.com / "lighttpd":http://www.lighttpd.net/ / "FastCGI":http://www.fastcgi.com/.
