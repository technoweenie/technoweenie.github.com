title: Ruby on Rails ported to Javascript
---
bq. "TrimPath Junction":http://trimpath.com/project/wiki/TrimJunction is a clone or port of the terrific Ruby on Rails web MVC framework into JavaScript.  TrimPath Junction is also sometimes referred to as TrimJunction, or as just Junction.  Or, in honor of its heritage, it's also sometimes called JavaScript on Junction (JoJ).

There's even a "Ruby-Javascript code comparison":http://trimpath.com/project/wiki/RubyRailsVsJavaScriptJunction, and a little "demo app":http://trimpath.com/demos/ongoal_static1/ongoal.htm.
