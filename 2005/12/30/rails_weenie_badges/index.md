title: Rails Weenie badges
---
I implemented Justin's rmagick jiggery pokery last night.  Here's "my Rails Weenie badge":http://rails.techno-weenie.net/user/badge/technoweenie.gif.  

I'm a bit torn on what to do with the project, however.  I have some ideas to expand it some, but I don't know if I should branch into a non-public repository.  The thought of a completely transparent service is interesting (like Michael's "llor.nu":http://llor.nu game, and I'm sure countless others).  Plus, it's really nice when "people fix your small bugs for you":http://collaboa.techno-weenie.net/tickets/3.
