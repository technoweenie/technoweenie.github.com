title: Safari to include RSS support
---
Looks like Safari may be the first big browser to include "native RSS support":http://www.apple.com/macosx/tiger/safari.html.  It looks pretty spiffy, and it will definitely get more people using RSS.  

The killer feature?  An RSS icon that pops up to alert you when a site has an available feed.  Currently, there isn't a simple way to do this without bookmarklets or opening your aggregator.

Can IE be far behind?  What about Firefox or Opera?

(Also, notice how they call it RSS, yet they support Atom... hmm...)
