title: brave new css world
---
I know it's impossible to get valid XHTML sites in ASP.Net without "extending the built-in controls":http://www.liquid-internet.co.uk/content/dynamic/pages/series1article1.aspx, but then you see articles like "Create Rollover Graphics in ASPX Pages":http://www.devx.com/tips/Tip/21061?trk=DXRSS_DOTNET.  Fine, that works.  But it's a brave new world, full of simple CSS tricks for "fast rollovers":http://www.pixy.cz/blogg/clanky/cssnopreloadrollovers/ and "css sprites":http://alistapart.com/articles/sprites/.  Just use the <code>CssClass</code> property and be done with it.
