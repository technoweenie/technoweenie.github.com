title: my next server, SFF dual opteron
---
Wow.  IWILL has a "dual opteron SFF case/motherboard":http://www.iwill.net/zmax/zmaxdp_1.asp coming out.  

Over the last year or so, I've gradually gone from desiring "the insanely fast, power hungry, and hot":http://www.pcper.com/article.php?aid=43 to "the silent, power saving, cool":http://www.silentpcreview.com/.  When I heard about the Radeon X800, I just thought "when does the X800 Mobile come out?"
