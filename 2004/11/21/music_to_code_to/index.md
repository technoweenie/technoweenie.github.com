"Dan Fernandez":http://blogs.msdn.com/danielfe/ (C# Program Manager) recently "pointed to":http://blogs.msdn.com/danielfe/archive/2004/11/17/259258.aspx  a custom house mix by "DJ Bolivia":http://www.djbolivia.ca/ specifically made for coders titled "I Never Expected This: Music to Code To":http://www.djbolivia.ca/bolivia.html#neverexpected.  

Overall, I think any good techno/house/acid jazz is pretty good for coding.  Other times I'm in a punk mood and play my NOFX collection.
