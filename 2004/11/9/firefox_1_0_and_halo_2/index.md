title: firefox 1.0 and halo 2
---
"Firefox":http://www.mozilla.org/ hit the 1.0 milestone.  There are also some "unofficial optimized builds":http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewforum.php?f=42 floating around.  I may try out one of these "SSE2-optimized builds":http://www.moox.ws/tech/mozilla/ and see if it makes a difference.

Oh yes, "Halo 2 came out":http://www.penny-arcade.com/view.php3?date=2004-11-08&res=l.   Find me on XBOX live as technoweenie if you want to challenge me.
