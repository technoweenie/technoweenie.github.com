title: ASP.Net and standards

Now that the browser wars have started up again (well ok, browser backyard scuffles), ASP.Net developers are actually checking their sites out and running into problems.  They expect that firefox is as capable as everyone says it is.  However, there are times when it's treated like a "second class browser":http://weblogs.asp.net/pleloup/archive/2004/11/03/251497.aspx due to sniffing, or it's given "proprietary javascript code":http://weblogs.asp.net/jasonsalas/archive/2004/11/09/254185.aspx.  

From what I've seen, things are looking good for ASP.Net 2.0.  But, how much can they really fix without breaking old sites or taking time away from more important features?
