title: Creative Zen Touch and MP3 ID3 tags
---
I recently picked up a "20GB Creative Zen Touch":http://www.creative.com/products/product.asp?prodid=10274.  Very cool.  It's not as sleek and cool as the Ipod, but it was much cheaper and has a 24 hour battery life.  Very cool.

Now, I'm cleaning up the MP3 ID3 tags on my music collection.  "ID3-TagIT":http://www.id3-tagit.de/english/index.htm is an awesome tag editor that matches my needs perfectly.  I have my songs organized by artist and album, but for whatever reason, the tags are messed up.  I'm able to check the tags, rename the filenames the way I like them, and fill in all the details from the CDDB.  Highly recommended.  (It's a .Net app too!)
