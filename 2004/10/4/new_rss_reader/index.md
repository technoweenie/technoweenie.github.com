With the news of its Bloglines integration, I'm back to using FeedDemon.  It's amazing how fast it is, and how low the memory footprint is.  What edges it out among the rest, is that I personally prefer reading my news in a blog-like format.  FeedDemon's newspaper view rocks.  

Also, I've moved my "link blog":http://del.icio.us/technoweenie/ to "del.icio.us":http://del.icio.us.  I figure it's the best solution that wasn't tied to Bloglines.  

I also really like "FeedBurner's:http://feedburner.com link/"flickr":http://flickr.com splicing feature.  It adds a little variety to my homepage.
