Bendis' hyped-up Avengers revamp has started with Avengers #500.  Love the fine art by David Finch.  Also, Marvel.com keeps track of "which Avengers are still left standing":http://marvel.com/publishing/stories/whosnext.htm.  Some of those descriptions are great. 

Volstagg -- Missed a few meals.  Found starved in cave (Thor #82)
Ironman -- Meltdown.  Hissy fit at the UN (Avengers #500)

But, why is Spider-man and the Fantastic Four listed?  Hmm...
