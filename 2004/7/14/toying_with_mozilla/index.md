title: toying with Mozilla

That Mozilla/XUL tutorial got me thinking.  It was easy enough to extract the Mozilla XUL/CSS/JS files and modify it directly.  Now, I remember there was some talk about "Mozilla and Gnome uniting to combat the Longhorn onslaught":http://www.google.com/search?q=mozilla+gnome.  That's all fine and dandy, but there needs to be a fairly simple way to introduce newbies to it.  Hacking the Mozilla .jar archives isn't really a suitable exercise for most folks.  

I did some digging and found the "XUL Runtime Environment":http://www.mozilla.org/projects/xul/xre.html.  This sounds really cool.
