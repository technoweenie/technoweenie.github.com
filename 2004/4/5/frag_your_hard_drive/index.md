"Brutal File Manager":http://slashdot.org/articles/04/04/04/1621251.shtml?tid=127&tid=186&tid=204 provides a 3D FPS(First Person Shooter) interface to your filesystem.  

I seem to recall an old DooM mod that provided a similar interface to your local computer's processes.  Kill a zombie to 'kill -9' the process the zombie was associated with.  Hmm.
