bq. Marvel Comics announces the launch of ICON, a new publishing imprint that will produce projects utilizing properties outside of the Marvel Universe.  ICON will launch with two titles fans are already familiar with: Brian Bendis' "Powers" and David Mack's "Kabuki."

I was wondering why Powers #1 hasn't come out yet...

bq. "Bendis":http://www.imagecomics.com/messageboard/viewtopic.php?t=29269: "Actually we were ready last Thursday, but we realized the date and figured no one would believe us. "
