Andyed "responds":http://www.surfmind.com/musings/2004/03/31/ to John Udell's "comparison":http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2004/03/31.html#a960 of Flex (MXML) and Avalon (XAML) by adding a third option: XUL.

Yes, XUL is cross platform and standards friendly, but where is it really used?  Besides Mozilla, I've only heard of a handful of other XUL products.  What XUL needs is some more publicity, and a lower barrier-to-entry.  If I could get some DLLs and python mods and write some wicked GUIs, I'd be all over it...
