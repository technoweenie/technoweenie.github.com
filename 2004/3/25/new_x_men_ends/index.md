title: New X-Men ends...
---
New X-Men #154 finishes Grant Morrison's run in a brilliant finale drawn by Marc Silvestri.  Though his run was often plagued with late and inconsistent art, it was a good jolt of fresh activity for the X-Men.  

Marvel's Reload event in May attempts to continue the trend with about fifty new mutant titles and handing over the core X-Men titles to Claremont and Austen.  So, it will be more like an _unload_ event for me.  I actually bought _every single issue_ of X-Treme X-Men.  See how bad complacency can get?  

On the other hand, I am definitely interested in Joss Whedon's new Astonishing X-Men title.  The very capable John Cassaday will provide the art.
