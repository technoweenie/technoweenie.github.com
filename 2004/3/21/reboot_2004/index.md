Due to some DNS issues, techno weenie has been down for awhile.

So, I took the time to refresh the site, get rid of old baggage, and try out "Textpattern":http://www.textpattern.com/.  I must say, I am very impressed with it.  However, I'd like to add some "funky caching":http://simon.incutio.com/archive/2003/05/05/cachingWithPHP to it.  Shouldn't be that difficult after some hacking here and there...

I spent some time redesigning the layout.  I'm no graphic designer, but my ideas were pretty decent.  After some time, my site evolved to a very minimalist design.  Then it hit me, _it looks just like the default Textpattern template, except it's green_.  

And that's why you won't see my designs in the "Zen Garden":http://www.csszengarden.com anytime soon.
