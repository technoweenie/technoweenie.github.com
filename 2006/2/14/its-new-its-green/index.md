I recently got contacted by "Justin Palmer":http://encytemedia.com/blog/ about mephisto.  He seemed to like the approach and noticed my complete lack of design skills.  We discussed some future possibilities of the app and spent some time during the weekend working on it.  At this point, he's integrated most of his new admin layout.  I spent the time renaming models and completely reworking the templates. 

It's still not ready for a public release, but I finally upgraded this blog with it.
