h2. mongrel

I've replaced webrick with "mongrel":http://mongrel.rubyforge.org/ as my rails web development server.  Lighttpd and/or fcgi didn't install correctly on my powerbook, so I've been using webrick for awhile.  mongrel, however, is quick and doesn't require any config files.  Windows users: don't despair!  Zed tells me that a windows mongrel service will be coming out too.

h2. rails recipes

Chad Fowler's latest book, "Rails Recipes":http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/fr_rr/index.html kicks ass.  His last one, "My Job Went to India":http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/mjwti/index.html was one of the catalysts that got me thinking about moving to freelancing... The other was "1000 Steps to World Domination":http://www.absolutetyrant.com/1000%20Steps%20to%20World%20Domination.htm.

h2. more mephisto changes

Sorry guys, I went and broke things again by renaming Mephisto categories to sections.  I think that name more accurately describes what they are.  This is just another warning that Mephisto is still not ready for actual use.
