title: why should we use microformats?
---
"John Allsopp":http://www.digital-web.com/about/contributors/john_allsopp/ has written a very insightful piece on the "Digital Web Magazine":http://www.digital-web.com - "The Big Picture on Microformats":http://www.digital-web.com/articles/the_big_picture_on_microformats/.

Frankly, you don't get a whole lot of benefit taking the time to implement them.  But, as the pioneers push on, more services will pop up, and it'll become more and more important to take advantage.
