title: Superman Returns

I am a comic geek, but I've never really be an avid Superman fan.  If you've seen the movie and are interested in picking up some actual comic books however, I strongly suggest "Superman: Birthright":http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?link_code=ur2&tag=technoweenie-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2F1401202527%2Fsr%3D8-1%2Fqid%3D1152669070%2Fref%3Dpd_bbs_1%3Fie%3DUTF8, ("wikipedia":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superman:_Birthright) a retelling of Superman's origin, updated for a modern audience.  I'm also having a lot of fun with "All Star Superman":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Star_Superman.
