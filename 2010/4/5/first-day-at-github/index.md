title: First day at GitHub
---
Today's my first day at [GitHub](http://github.com).  Leaving ENTP and ActiveReload was a hard decision, but I really felt like it was time to move on to something new.  I was very humbled by Chris' offer to join their growing team.  Apparently they need a drill sergeant to get the app ready for Rails 3.  My other recent interests (node.js, mongoDB, bourbon) also fit in well with the company.

I really just got to Portland (2 years ago), but this is a good chance to make the trek to San Francisco.  I grew up in a small Kansas town, and have basically been skirting around the idea of going to SF for years.  I'll likely stay in Portland for most of the summer, and move in the fall.  I don't know yet -- I was actually going to do this last year and chickened out :)

I feel very fortunate to be able to move from one kick ass company to another.  I'm really jazzed about what this year is going to be like at GitHub.
