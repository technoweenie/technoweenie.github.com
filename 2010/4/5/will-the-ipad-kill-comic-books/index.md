title: Will the iPad kill comic books?
---
### The Marvel App

Marvel has been dabbling in online comics for awhile.  They've had digital comic previews in an awkward flash interface for years, which has recently evolved into a monthly online service.  Lately, they've started producing [Motion Comics](http://marvel.com/motion_comics/).  So, it's not surprising that they're the first big comic company with a [serious iPad offering](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/marvel-comics/id350027738?mt=8).

### The Good

Marvel was smart to partner with [Comixology](http://www.comixology.com/).  Comics look _great_.  I'd recommend picking up the free Spider-Man issues if you want to check it out.  You can read a whole page, or go panel to panel if you like.  There are a lot of advantages when you compare the iPad to a single comic.  You can't tear anything, you can read in the dark, you can zoom in, etc.  Also, the iPad holds all of your purchases (or at least, your most recent ones).  You won't be stuck with a closet full of [long boxes](http://comicbooks.about.com/od/glossary/g/box.htm) after several years.  Also, I hoped that this would be better for the environment, but [it's not quite as simple as that](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2010/04/04/opinion/04opchart.html).  

Navigating the store and buying issues is easy enough.  You can search by Series, Genre, Creator, and Storylines.  If you find something you like, you can have the app send you notifications when new titles are added.  Instant gratification comic book Wednesdays!

### The Bad

There's the obvious downside:  These comics are protected and unshareable.  In fact, it's a little worse than other iTunes content because the files are hidden from you.  There's no way to export these comics for backup purposes, like you can with music or video.  However, I got a rapid response from their support center confirming that you are able to re-download anything you've purchased.

If this is a deal killer for you, hope is not lost on the iPad.  I've found the [Comic Zeal app](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/comic-zeal-comic-reader-4/id363990983?mt=8) to be decent for reading CBR files.  CBR files are basically scans of comics traded on Bit Torrent.  The quality varies, and the app isn't quite as smooth as Comixology's.  Personally, I only download what I already own, or seek out the graphic novels if I'm trying something new.

### The Loser

Unfortunately, if digital comics become popular, then the comic shops will suffer.  I like visiting [Floating World Comics](http://www.floatingworldcomics.com/main/) every week or so.  Jason gives me personal recommendations ([Paul Pope](http://www.amazon.com/100-Paul-Pope/dp/1401203493)), advanced screenings to movies, etc.  Floating Worlds sometimes holds special [First Thursday](http://www.firstthursdayportland.com/) events, such as the where I picked up my [original David Mack page](http://www.flickr.com/photos/technoweenie/3447609999/).

However, iTunes and Amazon have managed to kill off most of the indie book and music stores.  I fear the same fate awaits a lot of comic shops too.  What can I say though?  Comics on the iPad are cheaper, and more convenient to access and store digitally.  The same goes for books, movies, and music, even though I live close just a few blocks from a Powell's bookstore.

You know what I'd love?  Hardcover graphic novels with DVD's full of the digital content.

### The Verdict

Comixology and Marvel have won me over.  The iPad will likely become my preferred medium for reading comics.  I'm hoping that they increase the catalog significantly, or at least start offering new titles.  For instance, they're relaunching their flagship Avengers titles in May, and it'd be nice to pick those up on the iPad.

If you're interested in checking some comics out, I'd recommend:

* Iron Man #1-6
* Amazing Spider-Man #546-548
* Astonishing X-Men
* New Avengers
* Wolverine #20-31 (Enemy of the State, Agent of SHIELD)
* Captain America (Secret agent/espionage stuff)
* Planet Hulk (Hulk plays gladiator while stranded on an alien planet)

Check out the [Comixology app](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/comics/id303491945?mt=8) if superheroes aren't your thing.  I've been enjoying Madman so far.  Though, I'd wait a bit for Vertigo to come out with a competing service.

I'm curious how others are enjoying the comic book experience, whether you're a comic nut like me, a former reader, or  you've only seen the movies.
