title: selling out

So, I've sold out and set up a "tumblelog":http://technoweenie.tumblr.com/. Though I can do what I want on this blog, I feel like posting out-of-context quotes or pics would break up any flow this site may have.  I'm also in direct violation of rule #1 of the tumblelogging manifesto, "write your own software to do it":http://anarchaia.org/archive/2005/09.html.  Honestly, Mephisto can "power a tumblelog":http://jadedpixel.com/ too, but having a specific interface for it is nice.  Justin's been exposing me to some cool ruby/cocoa/objective c stuff, so I may end up doing something for Mephisto.  Just after I add APP(Atom Publishing Protocol) support.

next up: a myspace or virb profile...
