title: New Mint with Wii support
---
Not only is the "Wii revitalizing the gaming industry apparently":http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/31/technology/31game.html?_r=1&oref=slogin, it's providing new possibilities for web applications.

bq. single column mode (perfect for uni-taskers and those with Wiis!) 

(new feature for "Mint 2.0":http://www.haveamint.com/about/feature_highlights#new-in-2-features).
