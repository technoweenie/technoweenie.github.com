title: My talk about Twitter-Node at PDXJS
---
I was recently invited to talk about my [Twitter Node](http://github.com/technoweenie/twitter-node) project at last night's PDX Javascript Admirers meeting.  I was really nervous about giving my first talk in several years, but I did alright.  My slides are [up on Heroku](http://pdxjs-twitter-node.heroku.com/).

The big win of the talk, however, was Scott's [showoff](http://github.com/schacon/showoff) app for composing presentations.

Showoff is a sinatra app that builds a presentation from subdirectories of markdown files.  In the past, I'd spend a lot of time trying to make Keynote presentations look pretty, or fiddling with HTML for raw slides.  You know, I just don't care to do a lot of that stuff.  Showoff lets me focus on the content.  

One technique I really enjoyed, was showing a block of code in multiple slides and different comments.  The comments 'animate', pointing at whatever it is I was talking about.

Also, the rapid Heroku deployment saved us a bit of hassle.  I didn't have the right micro adapter for my laptop, so I was able to run the presentation just fine from another laptop.
