title: Debugging the Rails
---
Hey, if you're going to be in Austin, TX on January 17th, check out the "Austin on Rails":http://austinonrails.org/ group meeting.  Ruby hacker "Hal Fulton":http://www.rubyhacker.com/ is giving a presentation on Ruby that night.  And, for the first time ever, I will be attempting to follow up with my own presentation on debugging in Rails.
