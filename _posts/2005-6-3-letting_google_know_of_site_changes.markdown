title: letting google know of site changes
---
bq. "Google Sitemaps":https://www.google.com/webmasters/sitemaps/stats appears to be a feature I've been asking search engines to implement since 1997. Basically it lets you give the search engine a complete list of all files on your site and when they've last changed. That way the search engine doesn't have to re-read your whole site every day. -- "Dave Winer":http://archive.scripting.com/2005/06/03#When:11:21:47AM

Wow, Sitemaps could be huge.  Where is the textpattern plugin?
