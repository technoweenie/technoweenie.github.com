title: Announcing Lighthouse
---
If you look at the things "Mephisto":http://mephistoblog.com is missing, you'll see one glaring omission: Documentation?  Well yea..  But we also need a bug tracker.  Enter: "Lighthouse":http://www.lighthouseapp.com/, the first product from "Active Reload":http://activereload.net.  Justin and I made a great team on Mephisto, so it seemed natural to put that energy towards other things.  

Today, we decided to throw out a "quick sneak-peak":http://encytemedia.com/blog/articles/2007/2/23/introducing-active-reload-and-lighthouse before starting the beta period next week.  I'll also be starting a series of articles on the various plugins and libraries I've written while developing Lighthouse.  Lighthouse may not be OSS, but I'll be releasing as much of the infrastructure as I can.

Well, I didn't want to rehash Justin's excellent post, so I'll reveal what a typical day in the Active Reload (virtual) office is like.  This is where the magic happens.
