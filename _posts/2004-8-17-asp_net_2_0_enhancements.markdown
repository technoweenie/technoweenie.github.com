title: ASP.Net 2.0 enhancements
---
Fredrik Norm√©n talks about a couple ASP.Net 2.0 enhancements: "Expression Builders":http://fredrik.nsquared2.com/viewpost.aspx?PostID=161 and "List Control enhancements":http://fredrik.nsquared2.com/viewpost.aspx?PostID=160.  I've seen the new resource and connectionstring expressions, but I didn't realize it was extensible.  This could get interesting.

The AppendDataBoundItems property of the ListControls is great.  Most of the time in ASP.Net 1.x I was doing my own databinding because I wanted to set my own initial value.
