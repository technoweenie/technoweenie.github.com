title: tritium wifi antenna
---
If you remember my previous entries on "parabolic wifi antennas":http://techno-weenie.net/blog/index.php?q=wifi, then the "Tritium WiFi Antenna":http://www.tritium.co.uk/ might be of some interest.  It's a premade parabolic reflector, so no messing with printed out patterns.
