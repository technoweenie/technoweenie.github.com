title: half-life 2 timeline
---
If you need a little help with the Half-Life 2 story, check out this comprehensive "Half-Life Saga timeline":http://members.shaw.ca/storage_4/hl2story/.  I have no idea where he got all that background info from.  I saw those same newspaper clippings about the Portal Storms and 7 Hour War, but that's about it.

I am playing through it again to see if there are bits and pieces of the storyline I missed.  I'm also seeing if I can "spot G-Man":http://www.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?s=&threadid=182302.  I remember seeing him everywhere in Half-Life 1, but he's a lot more subtle in the sequel.
