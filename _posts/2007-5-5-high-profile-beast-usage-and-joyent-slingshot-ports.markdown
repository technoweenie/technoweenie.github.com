title: High profile Beast usage, and Joyent Slingshot ports
---
Joyent made their "public release of Slingshot":http://joyeur.com/2007/05/01/slingshot-public-release recently, along with a "Slingshot Port contest":http://developers.joyent.com/wiki/SlingshotPortContest to go with it.  Two of the listed entries include "Inferno":http://developers.joyent.com/wiki/ProjectInferno, a Mephisto port, and "Brute":http://developers.joyent.com/wiki/ProjectBrute, a Beast port.  Good luck to both entrants!  

Today, Matt at 37signals posted a "Design Decisions article":http://www.37signals.com/svn/posts/392-design-decisions-new-forums-at-basecamp-and-highrise about the move from punBB to Beast.  I love seeing Beast in action.
