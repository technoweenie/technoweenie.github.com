title: Is this thing on?
---
Apparently my "shady registrar":http://registerflies.com/ has been preventing some folks from visiting some sites.  Can you guys get to all these: "Mephisto Blog":http://mephistoblog.com, "Active Reload":http://activereload.net, "Encytemedia":http://encytemedia.com?  This isn't some ploy for attention, but Justin has flaky access, and I've gotten some emails about other folks too.  So far we haven't had any luck with domain transfers.

*Update:* Thanks for the updates, everyone.  -I've started a transfer with Moniker-  Had some issues, going with godaddy now.
