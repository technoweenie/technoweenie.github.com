You know what, I _loved_ the LOST finale.  I've been thinking a lot about it, and reading the varied reactions for the last week.  Needless to say, this post will be very spoilery if you care about such things.

It managed to wrap up the various main character plots in a fitting way.  We see who made it out alive, who becomes the new protector, and even who Kate chooses.  

Michael Koziarski asked for a [140 character summary](http://twitter.com/nzkoz/status/14607315672), and this is what I gave him:

"Some people crash on an island.  They become friends." ([src](http://twitter.com/technoweenie/status/14607499431))

Over the course of 6 seasons, we saw detailed histories of all the main characters.  When they ran out of flash backs to show, we got flash forwards of the characters after they leave the island.  And when _that_ well was tapped, we saw these characters in the after-life.  Whew!

Unfortunately, the Island was one of those characters, and the Island's history was not as thoroughly explained as the other characters'.  How did time traveling work?  Why couldn't women get pregnant on the island?  Why didn't light scatter quite right?

**Quit being such a _Jack_ about it ;)**

The finale set up a Man of Science vs Man of Faith debate among the fans.  In season 2 of LOST, Jack and Locke had this epic debate about the hatch and the infamous button.  

<pre>Jack: It's a button.  
Locke: It's a leap of faith, Jack.</pre>

Jack couldn't accept that this was destiny, and it broke him.  It wasn't until he let go that he could save the <s>island</s> world.

I'm definitely not a religious person, I'm a geeky computer programmer.  By all rights, I should be a Man of Science.  But, this is an American TV show written by two guys that [worked on Nash Bridges](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115285/).  They're not quantum physicists. 

I also believe that Damon and Carlton were fighting against the network.  How the hell do you come up with a compelling show when ABC tells you they want "[Castaway, the series](http://www.dvdtown.com/reviews/lost-the-complete-1st-season/3103)"?  How do you effectively tell epic serialized fiction without having a planned timeline?  Comic books have a similar challenge (X-Men), but also have to deal with constantly rotating creators.  In my experience, the best results come from the creators having more control over the whole scope (Y: The Last Man, Harry Potter, etc).  American TV just doesn't work that way.

It's also not like unsolved sci-fi questions are unique to LOST:

* How does the [Flux Capacitor](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zq5-6PkVGCg) work?
* How does Tony Stark build a miniature arc reactor in an Afghanistan cave?
* What is the Force (Ok, we actually [know this one](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force_\(Star_Wars\)#Midi-chlorians_and_the_Chosen_One))?  
* How does a [shiftship powered by a caged baby universe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Carrier) travel through parallel universes?

I don't really know, and I don't really care.  It's all just fucking cool.  If you need more then that, then the answer is always [the Hurley Bird](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkmnxL31PeE).

And finally, here's what is probably my favorite LOST scene:
