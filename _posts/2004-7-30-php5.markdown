PHP5 has been released (old news for most of you), and apparently "it kicks ass":http://otn.oracle.com/pub/articles/hull_asp.html.  Okay, that's a laughable comparison of ASP.Net and PHP5.

Anyways, PHP5 is a god send if you're a PHP guy.  And, if you can't find a host to try it on, try it with "Xitami":http://www.xitami.com/, a simple web server.
