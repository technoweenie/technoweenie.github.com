title: two new ruby on rails tips
---
First, I have a little RJS example that takes your standard scaffolded model form and "turns it into an AJAX form":http://rails.techno-weenie.net/tip/2005/11/29/ajaxed_forms_with_rjs_templates.  Click create and watch the form blind up and out of the way on successful requests, or watch the errors fill in on invalid ones.

Notice the new syntax highlighting?  I used HTML::Tokenizer to find any code tags and highlight the code in them using the Syntax gem.  I hear Typo does the same thing, but I wasn't able to find the exact code.  So, I "wrote my own":http://rails.techno-weenie.net/tip/2005/11/29/textilize_with_syntax_highlighting.
