title: DOM-Scripted Lists, revisited
---
Gazingus.org updated their "original DHTML List":http://gazingus.org/html/Using_Lists_for_DHTML_Menus.html example with "DOM-Scripted Lists, Revisited":http://gazingus.org/html/DOM-Scripted_Lists_Revisited.html.  I did notice a slight bug on the final example showing the use of an image instead of a plus:  the plus is visible to the left.  It's far enough out that most people won't see it, but it's there.
