title: Firefox Anarchy
---
Well known techniques for modifying a site's display, up until now, have been pretty basic.  We've been able to change colors and fonts for awhile now, and even "block ads":http://update.mozilla.org/extensions/moreinfo.php?application=firefox&id=10&vid=215 on the page.

Adrian Holovaty has come up with something a little more devious: a "firefox extension that fixes some accessibility issues with AllMusic.com":http://www.holovaty.com/blog/archive/2004/07/19/2210.   There are some extensions to reclaim your right-click, block flash files, etc.  Then, there's the original "CSS Anarchist":http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/network/2000/07/21/magazine/css_anarchist.html.  But, I think Adrian takes the site hacking to a new level here.

There is one key difference between these hacks, and plugins like "smart tags":http://old.alistapart.com/stories/smarttags/3.html or spyware:  They are used to enhance the usability or accessibility of a document, as opposed to providing advertising revenue for someone.
