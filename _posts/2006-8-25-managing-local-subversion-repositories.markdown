"Piston":http://piston.rubyforge.org looks like it could be a nice alternative to svk.

bq. Piston is a utility that enables merge tracking of remote repositories. This is similar to svn:externals, except you have a local copy of the files, which you can modify at will. As long as the changes are mergeable, you should have no problems.
