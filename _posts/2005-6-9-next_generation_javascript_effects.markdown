title: next generation javascript effects
---
"Thomas Fuchs":http://mir.aculo.us has been kicking ass lately with his ever-growing library of javascript effects.  He's taken his current work in "prototype":http://prototype.conio.net/ further with "Effects v2":http://mir.aculo.us/effects/index.html.  He just announced a "sortable drag and drop library":http://mir.aculo.us/demos/draggable2.html today to complement that.  

You can see something similar in use in "RailsDay entry #128":http://railsday.com/svn/railsday128/ (try the "demo":http://railsday.larsen.st/, login as demo/demo for the admin interface).
