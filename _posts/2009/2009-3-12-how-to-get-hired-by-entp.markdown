At ActiveReload, our question was "How good are you at Gears of War?"  [Will](http://twitter.com/imagetic) qualified with flying colors (he was 100th _in the world_).

Last year as ENTP was starting, it was "How good are you at Rock Band?"  [Towski](http://twitter.com/towski) impressed us with his killer Chris Cornell impersonation.

Now, we're looking for that person with elite [Korg Kaossilator](http://www.korg.co.uk/products/dance_dj/kaossilator/kaossilator.asp) experience.  Is that someone out there?
