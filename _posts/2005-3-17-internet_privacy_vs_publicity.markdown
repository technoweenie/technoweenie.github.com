title: internet privacy vs publicity
---
It seems everyone has their own idea of what "Web 1.0 means and what Web 2.0 means":http://msnbc.msn.com/id/6214349/site/newsweek/, but <cite>Josh Petersen</cite> from "Robot Co-op":http://robotcoop.com/ has "a different idea":http://robotcoop.com/weblog/62/identity-toward-an-internet-publicity-policy:

bq. "If internet 1.0 was mostly about making the internet work for business, internet 2.0 seems to me to be more about making it work for people â€“ and part of that shift means some tectonic changes in the relationships between individuals and the corporations that earn their custom."

But remember, there are still some relics of the ancient Web 1.0 ready to "harvest your user data":http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20050316-4711.html?69557.  Of course Google falls in to this camp with Gmail, but they are keeping that localized to one service and they make it abundantly clear.
