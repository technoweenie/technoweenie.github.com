title: random gmail invite raffle
---
Fourteen people gave out a total of 55 gmail invites for free.  The catch?  The "free gmail invite":http://www.moensolutions.com/sm-gmail.php page generated a random number with a 1-in-500 chance of getting a free account.  Looks like users went through over 18GB of traffic to get a free account.  Ouch.

When Kevin Rose had his "gmail invite page":http://kevinrose.typepad.com/kr/2004/06/free_gmail_1.html, I actually received an invite code.  But, it was already used up.   Doh...
