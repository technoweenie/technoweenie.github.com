title: source control for dummies (couldn't resist)
---
"Eric Sink":http://software.ericsink.com/ is writing a fantastic series on "source control":http://software.ericsink.com/scm/.  

bq. "Our universities don't teach people how to do source control, or at least mine didn't.  We graduate with Computer Science degrees.  We know more than we'll ever need to know about discrete math, artificial intelligence and the design of virtual memory systems.  But many of us enter the workforce with no knowledge of how to use any of the basic tools of software development, including bug-tracking, unit testing, code coverage, source control, or even IDEs."
