look at what "blogging":http://channel9.msdn.com/ did for Microsoft: it put a human face on the _evil empire_.

I hear word about a new Marvel imprint, but there's no mention of it on their site.  I find news of new Marvel developments printed on paper before seeing them on the website.  Isn't that a little backwards?
