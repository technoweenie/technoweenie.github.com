"Dare Obasanjo":http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/ has a big entry about "secret identities in recent comics and Captain America":http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/CommentView.aspx?guid=55b5a6b7-ceb3-4149-bf6a-da87ffca8a63.

I found Ultimates to be a great read (especially when all the issues were finally out), but Mark Millar wrote all the characters as assholes.  You'd think that moving to the mainstream Spider-Man title, he would write a genuinely good character.  Even Peter Parker is a bit of a jerk (to be fair, he was going through some serious evil-doer-knows-his-secret-identity crisis).

As for the whole secret identity issue, I really love the recent turn of events in Daredevil.  His secret identity was kind of a joke, since all of his girlfriends and major enemies knew it.  It only makes sense that it got out into the tabloids eventually.  But, I expected some reality distortion time warping field to fix that.  Instead, it seems this is the new status quo for Daredevil, identity outed and all.
