title: Interactive (Iron)Python Scripting Example
---
Jim Hugunin has an "Interactive Python Scripting Example":http://blogs.msdn.com/hugunin/archive/2004/08/23/219186.aspx up.  One interesting thing in his example is he puts the form in a new Thread.  I tried similar GUI examples without a new thread and had the whole thing lock up on me (which shows how little I know about windows forms and threads).
