title: free your tunes

The "hymn project":http://hymn-project.org/ has been relaunched, with a new name and some legal backing.  It was originally called playfair, and was used to strip m4p files of their encryption.

Here's the new process:

# Buy song from iTunes
# run hymn and conver the m4p to an m4a
# use iTunes to convert the m4a to mp3
# play in winamp

iTunes is nice and all, but I still prefer winamp for my music playing, and iTunes for online purchase (right up until the price increase anyhow).
