title: google browser?

I first saw this at Slashdot:

bq. "The "New York Post is reporting":http://www.nypost.com/business/30438.htm that 'Based on the half-dozen hires in recent weeks, Google appears to be planning to launch its own Web browser and other software products to challenge Microsoft.' I took a guess and did a whois search for Gbrowser.com and indeed Google Inc. is listed as the registrar." -- "Will Google Launch a Browser?":http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/09/21/0011207

There are a couple more "bread":http://www.deftone.com/blogzilla/archives/google_browser.html "crumbs":http://www.kottke.org/04/09/more-google-browser to follow on this.
