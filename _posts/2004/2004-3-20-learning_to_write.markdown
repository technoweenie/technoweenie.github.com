"Mark":http://diveintomark.org "explores":http://diveintomark.org/archives/2004/03/20/assets what it takes to be a good writer, and how that plays into being a good blogger.

I definitely believe I'm in category 3 (write poorly but don't care).  When I started writing on the web nearly six years ago, I hoped that the constant reading/writing would improve my skills.  Maybe it has, but not enough.  My writing has no _voice_.  You can read something of Mark's and see a personality.  You read something of mine and you see a flat transcript.

What would definitely help me would be some _variety_ in what I read.  Reading other [poorly written] weblogs won't help.  Neither will reading comic books (doh!).  I need to read some good, old fashioned books possibly.
