title: firefox + java problems
---
I've been having problems running Java applets in Firefox.  Specifically, the browser quits loading web pages, and I have to kill the process with Task Manager.

The registry entry from the "Java FAQ":http://plugindoc.mozdev.org/faqs/java.html seemed to have fixed things, however.
