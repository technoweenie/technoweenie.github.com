tool-man has come up with a "CSS based organizational chart":http://www.surfare.net/~toolman/temp/diagram.html solution for those that don't want to mess with "monolithic, bloated, binary formats":http://diveintomark.org/archives/2004/04/06/interoperability or "dynamic html scripts":http://w3future.com/html/orgcharts.html.

On a side note, it looks like "the wizards":http://q42.nl/ behind "Xopus":http://www.xopus.com (the friendly standards-compliant browser-based xml editor) have an "org chart demo":http://www.xopus.com/demo/orgchart/xopus/xopus.html#../demos/orgcharts/orgcharts.xml.
