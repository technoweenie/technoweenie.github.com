# Compulsive physiological and psychological need for a habit-forming substance

After Grant Morrison's _New X-Men_ run ended, I've slimmed down my X-Men collecting habits to just two mutant titles: Astonishing X-Men and Ultimate X-Men.  But, there are still the sin of the past and present:

* I bought every single boring issue of X-Treme X-Men.
* I bought every single boring issue of Chuck Austen's X-Men (though I liked the addition of Havok and Juggernaut)
* I'm reading "this thread about Excalibur":http://barbelith.com/topic/17902.

It's not that I deluded myself into thinking that the lasting effects in New X-Men wouldn't be reversed or rewritten.  It's just that it happend _so fast_.  Xorn is revealed to be alive and well in China (which blatantly contradicts the recent Planet X story).  Magneto and Professor X have been working together to rebuild Genosha after its devastation.  Nice idea, except for the part of the evil Magneto clone that destroyed NYC and killed Jean Grey (for the third? fourth? fifth time?).

Though I'm enjoying the savings in cash from all the X-Men titles I'm not buying, it's a little tough to keep my X-Men blinders on.  I've tried it several times, but something X-Men related always awakens the compulsive X-Men fanboy, and I return.
