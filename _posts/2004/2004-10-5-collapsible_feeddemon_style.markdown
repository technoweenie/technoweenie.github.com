title: collapsible feeddemon style
---
One pet peeve of mine about certain full-text feeds, is they include full source code or extremely long rants.  Even if I don't feel like reading all of it, I still have to scroll past.

Bloglines has a great expandable/collapsible feature that is configurable for each feed.  I set out to enable the same featureset in FeedDemon and found that it was extremely flexible.  So, I built a collapsible style using Simple as a base.  Then, I used Radek's "polystyle":http://www.republika.pl/fdstyles/Polystyle.html style, which sets a seperate style for each group/channel.  Awesome.  

I really like his idea of rating entries as well. 

To try it out, put "SimpleCollapsible.fdxsl":http://techno-weenie.net/code/2004/10/SimpleCollapsible.fdxsl in the /Styles/ folder of your cache folder @(File > Open Cache Folder)@
