title: future of data programming

Anders Hejlsberg talks "Programming data in C# 3.0":http://channel9.msdn.com/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=10276 at "Channel 9":http://channel9.msdn.com.  That's misleading.  He really just explains the current problems.  But, we know the "current problems":http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2003/12/31/HeWantsEverything.  There's still a mismatch in working between objects and databases.  XML tried to be our savior, but it's turning into "its own datasource":http://beta.asp.net/quickstart/aspnet/doc/data.aspx.

"Some":http://sqlobject.org/ "good":http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/cpref/html/frlrfSystemXmlSerializationXmlSerializerClassTopic.asp "progress":http://php.net/simplexml has been made, with some hope for the "future":http://www.longhornblogs.com/rdawson/archive/2004/03/23/2822.aspx.   Maybe there is no right answer for everyone.  Each technique is useful in its own right.
