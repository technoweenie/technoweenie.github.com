title: chronicles of riddick
---
If you own an xbox, you must pick up "The Chronicles of Riddick: Escape From Butcher Bay":http://www.gamespot.com/xbox/action/chroniclesofriddick/review.html.  Do you loathe "Vin Diesel":http://www.google.com/search?q=i+hate+vin+diesel and the movie Pitch Black?  Don't worry about it -- Escape from Butcher Bay is great.  

It's part action FPS, covert-stealth game (with some wicked dynamic lighting), and prison brawling simulation.  

Two things:  First, if you don't have a high definition display, the graphics will look pixelicious (no HDTV? use a "monitor":http://www.x2vga.com/).  Second, with no multiplayer mode, the game won't have a whole lot of replay value.

At least give the game a shot.  You can probably rent it and beat it over the weekend...
