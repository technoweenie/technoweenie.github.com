title: gmail as a blogging tool

"Gallina":http://ion.gluch.org.mx/files/Hacks/gallina/ is a blogger engine running off gmail.  Messages are blog entries, and replies to messages are comments.  It's not the first time the email&#187;blog barrier has been broken, but Gallina is apparently <em>shit hot</em> because it's related to gmail. -- via "slashdot":http://slashdot.org/articles/04/09/06/1255209.shtml?tid=217&tid=95&tid=1
