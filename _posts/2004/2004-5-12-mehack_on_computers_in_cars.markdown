title: mehack on computers in cars

bq. i've been looking into building a general purpose computer into my car for a while now, but one of the reasons i went with the carbot is because it already has an integrated power management solution -- "mehack":http://www.mehack.com/index.cgi/cars/installing-carbot.html

Hmm....
