title: CSS Box Model demo
---
When teaching the CSS box model, I usually whip out the pen and paper to sketch it.  But, I can only really do a flat, 2D view that resembles the "w3c box model diagram":http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS2/box.html#box-dimensions.  Jon Hicks created a very slick "3D CSS Box Model diagram":http://www.hicksdesign.co.uk/journal/2004/05/3d_css_box_model/index.php

I think some new people may have problems translating that to the web page, Douglas created an "interactive CSS box model demo":http://www.redmelon.net/tstme/box_model/.  It's modeled after Jon's, with a slider that goes from a 3D isometric view to a flat 2D view.  Awesome.
