title: whatever happened to an old fashioned beating?
---
This is hilarious, an enraged father is "selling his son's PS2(Playstation 2)":http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&category=62054&item=8107675670&rd=1 as a punshment.

What's worse?  Being grounded, losing a PS2, or having nearly a half million Ebay viewers read the story?  I bet the kid's getting all kinds of shit at school.

What's next, a belt lashing webcast?
