title: popup blocking lies!
---
Don't believe the hype!  Firefox doesn't block all popups.  I recently saw some on a site while reading an article there.  Luckily, it's a reputable site, so my screen wasn't filled with neverending windows of cheerleader porn.  But still...

From an uneducated guess it seems like the popup add code is in the links to the rest of the article, so the browser sees it as a user action.
