title: Longhorn trimmed down
---
Apparently, Longhorn is "being trimmed down because it's too complex":http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2004/Aug04/08-27Target2006PR.asp.  From what I gather, this means no WinFS.  But, it sounds like WinFX (managed Win32 API), Avalon (wicked GUI layer), and Indigo will not be dependant on Longhorn, but available on Windows XP/2003.  

This should help adoption of those technologies.  People will be more inclined to write the "next generation apps" with Avalon if there's a much larger installed base.
