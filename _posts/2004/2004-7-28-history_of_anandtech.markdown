title: History of Anandtech

AnandTech keeps up their tradition of "explaining their site architecture in depth":http://www.anandtech.com/IT/showdoc.aspx?i=2136.  I found a few really interesting points in this.  One, it talks about their move to ColdFusion and ultimately to ASP.Net in the latest revision.  It also mentions how they moved to a CSS based layout, cutting out unnecessary tables, and dropping the page size from 130k to 45k.  It doesn't validate, but it's still great progress.
