My Netgear WGT624 (108Mb wireless firewall/router) has been having problems all day.  It's odd, because none of the configuration changed, and the wired connections work fine.

I know the AP isn't in the best spot (it's hooked up to the cable outlet in the main bedroom), and it had a cable modem, computer, and monitor all right by it.  But, it worked great on Saturday.  I had music playing over the network to my XBox, downloads going to my laptop, and a windows installation in process on the computer.

I ran into "NetStumbler":http://www.netstumbler.org/, a good little utility for detecting wireless networks.  I must say, my connection to my own AP looks a little spotty (I wish I had results from when it _was_ working to go by).

Did my router crap out?  Maybe I should try setting up an adhoc network between my laptop and XBox, to rule out the possibility of either of them being faulty...
