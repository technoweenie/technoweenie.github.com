title: strongly typed objects instead of datasets
---
Plip has some tips on "using strongly typed objects and collections instead of datasets":http://weblogs.asp.net/plip/archive/2004/04/11/111128.aspx. It's very similar to a technique that I've been using for awhile now.  Nice to know that I'm on the right track.

He does go further into filtering a sorting than I ever did, however.
