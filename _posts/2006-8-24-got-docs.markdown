title: Got Docs?
---
I've recently discovered "gotAPI":http://www.gotapi.com/, and started using it for my own rails documention needs.  What sets it apart from "other tools":http://railshelp.com/, is the addition of documentation on other topics.  I currently have tabs for HTML DOM, CSS, and Prototype, as well.  All have their uses during regular Rails development.
