Just got back from seeing Nine Inch Nails at Stubb's BBQ in Austin.  Great show.  However, it was odd seeing nin play such a small venue tonight.  No big video screens or anything like the Fragility tour.

Anyways, you can view "my crappy cell phone pictures":http://flickr.com/photos/technoweenie/sets/378747/, or just look for "'nin' photos at Flickr":http://flickr.com/photos/tags/nin/.
