title: The New West
---
Rarely does something new come out and totally blow me away.  The New West by Jimmy Palmiotti and Phil Noto did just that.  I picked it up purely on a wim, trying to be some hip, indie comic book reader.  It's a detective story set in LA, which is more info than I had going in.

Grant Morrison's ambitions Seven Soldiers project is actually pretty good.  I know very little about these characters (apparently they're revamps of old/existing DC characters?), but I've been enjoying all the various issues that have come out so far.

Finally, the latest Daredevil arc, Decalogue, started on Wednesday with #71.  It's about Daredevil's massive cleanup of Hell's Kitchen, told in themed stories relating to the ten commandments.
