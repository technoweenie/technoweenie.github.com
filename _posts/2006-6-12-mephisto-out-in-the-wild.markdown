title: Mephisto out in the wild
---
I spent the weekend helping a couple folks get up to speed with "Mephisto":http://svn.techno-weenie.net/projects/mephisto/trunk/.  "Chris":http://outside-thoughts.octopod.info/ and "Dan":http://piece.dpiddy.net have both been helping out with the Typo Converter.  Using that, Dan launched the new "Ruby on Rails Weblog":http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/ last night.  It's really cool that folks are starting to use Mephisto in ways that I don't on my own blog.  I've made several good enhancements and fixes based on their feedback.  I can't say when I'll be ready to make an official release though.  Definitely not before I have a "kick ass default theme":http://warpspire.com/hemingway and documentation for the templating system.
