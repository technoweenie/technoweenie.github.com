title: Another Mephisto Launch
---
Wow, so apparently getting your software used on the main Rails site attracts a little attention :)  I'm really excited to see that the new "Rails Machine":http://railsmachine.com/ site has been launched.  I worked with Brad a little this weekend helping him get set up.  This site is special because it's the first to really take advantage of the light-CMS capabilities of Mephisto.  He even wrote up a little guide for "deploying Mephisto":https://support.railsmachine.com/index.php?pg=kb.page&id=13.  

So what's next for Mephisto?  Justin has done a killer job "updating Mephisto's admin UI":http://encytemedia.com/blog/articles/2006/06/13/railsconf-railsday-vacation-and-mephisto.  I just have a few issues to work out, and some documentation to write, and we should be ready for an initial "0.5" release.  Next week if all goes to plan...
