A few months ago, Google deemed it necessary to flood me with invites.  It just seemed wrong for them to sit there, so I donated them to some site that collects them and issues them out to folks.  Now I'm starting to get notices of all these people joining up.  I guess I can expect about 45 more of these...

And just for the record, Google gave me 50 *more* invites!
