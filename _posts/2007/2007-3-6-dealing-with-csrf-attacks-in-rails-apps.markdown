title: Dealing with CSRF Attacks in Rails Apps
---
I've posted my first technical blog article on the Active Reload blog: "Your Requests Are Safe With Us":http://activereload.net/2007/3/6/your-requests-are-safe-with-us.  It's a rundown of the CSRF Killer plugin for Rails apps that I developed while working on Lighthouse.  I was working on an examination of the cool keyword searching in Lighthouse, but I saw yet another CSRF article today and wanted to get my plugin out there.

Expect more of those technical Lighthouse posts.  Since it's not an open source app, I'm extracting what I can into useful rails plugins, ruby libraries, and informational blog posts.
