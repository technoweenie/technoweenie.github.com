title: Lighthouse launched
---
So, "Lighthouse":http://lighthouseapp.com/ finally launched last week.  We got caught up in launch parties, schmoozing, booze, etc and I never got a chance to update the blog.  Okay, seriously, we're not rockstars, we've "been busy":http://activereload.net/2007/4/1/lighthouse-updates. 

*DNS Update:*  mephistoblog and railsweenie both failed.  Registerfly thought it was necessary to lock my domains and make it impossible to unlock.  Thanks, guys!
