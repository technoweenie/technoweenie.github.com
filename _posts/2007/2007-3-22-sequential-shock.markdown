Yesterday was comic book day, and I picked up "Y: THE LAST MAN #55":http://www.dccomics.com/comics/?cm=7042.  Something happened that's never happened to me before: reading the comic made me _jump_.  That's a difficult thing to do without adding intentionally loud sound effects, especially when nearly every other page is a lame video game ad (to be fair, Vertigo is a more mature imprint, so it's half video games, half ads for other comics).  Anyways, kudos to Brian Vaughan and Pia Guerra.

(If you have no clue what I'm talking about, "Y: The Last Man":http://www.dccomics.com/graphic_novels/?gn=1736 is a monthly comic series, just entering its final story arch.  Vaughan has written a lot of other fantastic comics (and some mediocre ones), and recently joined the cast of the LOST TV show as a writer.)
