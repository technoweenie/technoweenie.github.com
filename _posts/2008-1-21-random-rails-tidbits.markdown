With "ActiveSupport::Callbacks being extracted out of ActiveRecord":http://dev.rubyonrails.org/changeset/8664 and "ActiveSupport::Validations on the way":http://dev.rubyonrails.org/ticket/10876, it looks like Josh and lifo both did a large chunk of the work I was going to do for ActiveModel.

Apparently the "Russian Mafia":http://www.novemberain.com/2008/1/20/russian-mafia-saves-the-world is spreading git propaganda and "speeding up the Rails routing implementation":http://www.novemberain.com/2008/1/17/routes-recognition.  Bravo!

The QuarkRuby folks succeeded in "hacking ActiveResource to access Youtube videos":http://www.quarkruby.com/2008/1/15/activeresource-and-youtube.  I think there may be an opportunity to tweak ActiveResource under the hood to make these sorts of plugins easier.
