bq. Sorry, if you do a marketing site and you don't have an RSS feed today you should be fired.

I can't even fathom having a site without an RSS feed.  Or a blog.  But, there's this whole world of folks that still don't know of these things.  I don't think I know of more than five people that actually uses an aggregator or reads blogs.  

Maybe that says more about where I live than anything...
