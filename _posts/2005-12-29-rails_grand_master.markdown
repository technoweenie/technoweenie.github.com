So, I've been thinking about adding some kind of skill ladder to Rails Weenie since its launch.  There's a new feature coming up that's made me think about this more seriously.  If you have any ideas, add them in the comments.  I'll put ones I like on my "tadalist":http://technoweenie.tadalist.com/lists/public/177738 for it.

I'm also thinking of increasing the amount of points.  Perhaps giving 15 or 20 by default.  I'll do some experimenting with it.
