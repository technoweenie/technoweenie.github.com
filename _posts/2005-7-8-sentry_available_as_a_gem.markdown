title: sentry available as a gem

Check the _extensive_ "README":http://www.techno-weenie.net/svn/projects/sentry/README for full details.  

It's online in a permanent spot, readily available, and "checked into subversion":http://techno-weenie.net/svn/projects/sentry.  Once Textdrive gets the ruby/svn bindings, I'll try loading Collaboa on the whole projects repository.  Patches are welcome, but I definitely plan to hack on the code some more.
