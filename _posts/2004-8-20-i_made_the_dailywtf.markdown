title: i made the DailyWTF!
---
I'm excited, one of my ASP.Net code snippets made the "Daily WTF":http://thedailywtf.com/archive/2004/08/20/1279.aspx!  It's my wonderful database stored procedures and parameters implementation done with String.Replace and a bunch of queries in the Web.Config.  

When I was introduced to ASP.Net and the global configuration file, I went nuts with it and decided to integrate my data layer with it. 

I'm sure any programmer can look at their old projects and think WTF(What the fuck)!?!??!
