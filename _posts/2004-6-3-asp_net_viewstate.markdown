---
"Scott Mitchell":http://4guysfromrolla.com has an excellent MSDN article "Understanding ASP.NET View State":http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnaspp/html/viewstate.asp.  It's important if you...

# Want a better understanding of the ASP.Net lifecycle and control events
# Want to store the Viewstate in an alternate location, such as "on the web server filesystem":http://www.hanselman.com/blog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=291897dc-555d-44a1-ab94-65a70e484b3e
# Want to "compress":http://www.mostlylucid.co.uk/archive/2004/01/03/694.aspx or encrypt the viewstate
