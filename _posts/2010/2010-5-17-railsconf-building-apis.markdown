title: "Railsconf: Building APIs"
---

I'm going to be taking Chris' place in the [Building an API](http://en.oreilly.com/rails2010/public/schedule/detail/14502) panel at Railsconf in June.  I'll be speaking about the GitHub API (of course), as well as touching on my experiences building APIs for Lighthouse and Tender.

Don't despair, Chris will still be doing his [Redis, Rails, and  Reque](http://en.oreilly.com/rails2010/public/schedule/detail/14595) talk.
