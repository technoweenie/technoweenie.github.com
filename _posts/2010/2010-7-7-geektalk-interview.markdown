title: Geek Talk Interview
---

So, I was interviewed by [The Geek Talk](http://thegeektalk.com/interviews/rick-olson/) recently.  Read on to learn the awful truth behind my early programming days :)

Also, I'm moving to San Francisco this weekend.  I'm really looking forward to working side by side with my fellow GitHubbers.  Portland's a great place, and I have a feeling I'll be back.
