title: Visual Studio Express
---
On a _good_ note, the beta "Visual Studio 2005 Express":http://lab.msdn.microsoft.com/express/ line has been released.  I downloaded Visual Web Developer express to play with.  A little buggy, but the IDE is a *vast* improvement.  XHTML 1.1 conformance out of the box, a standards compliant designer that I don't hate, intellisense all over the place, etc.

SQL Server 2005 Express is now an XPath-querying XML database too, so I want to try that out.

There's also the "Summer of Express":http://channel9.msdn.com/express/ coding contest.  I may not enter to give the rest of you a chance though (note the intense sarcasm).
