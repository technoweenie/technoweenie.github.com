title: x-men unload
---
This month starts my boycott of the X-Men titles.  This is the fourth time (and I'll probably go back when a good writer starts, and feel a need to catch up on back issues I missed).  But, there is hope in the form of -Liefeld's X-Force- +Joss Whedon's Astonishing X-Men+.

Titles I _am_ enjoying this month are Supreme Power, Superman: Birthright, and Y: The Last Man.
