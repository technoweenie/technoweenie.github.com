title: Hey, a useful widget!
---
So far, I haven't been all that impressed with the Dashboard widgets in Tiger.  More eye candy than functionality (and the sweet ripple effects don't even work on my Mini).  

Enter "Flidget":http://www.dashboardwidgets.com/showcase/details.php?wid=204, the Flickr uploading widget by "Anatoly":http://fecklessmind.com/main/10/flidget---the-flickr-widget and "Rob":http://zooibaai.nl/archives/2005/05/01/of-design-mac-and-flickr/.  Cool stuff.  The fact that you can drag files from the desktop to the dashboard is _very_ handy.  

Okay, I know there are lots of other useful widgets, but none that I really need at the moment.  "Flidget rocks though":http://flickr.com/photos/technoweenie/13500925/.
