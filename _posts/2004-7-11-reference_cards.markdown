These quick "Reference Cards":http://refcards.com/ look useful.  There are lots of good Linux/Apache/Web/MySQL stuff there.  

My favorite was always doing PHP function lookups ("http://php.net/strnatcasecmp":http://php.net/strnatcasecmp), but .Net Documentation is pretty good too ("XmlSerializer":http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&ie=UTF-8&q=XmlSerializer&btnI=I'm+Feeling+Lucky _I'm Feeling Lucky_ search).
