Here was the original premise: what if we built an ajax auction site?  Somewhere during the planning discussion earlier in the week, the concept of blog badges was kicked around, so we called it "Bloction":http://bloction.com/.  "We" meaning: "team monkey patch":http://spectate.railsday2006.com/changesets/teams/1/, made up of "Courtenay":http://blog.caboo.se/, "Justin Palmer":http://encytemedia.com/blog/articles/2006/06/13/railsconf-railsday-vacation-and-mephisto, and myself.  We all brought our A games for Bloction.
