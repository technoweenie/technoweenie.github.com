Two big releases today:  Ultimate Fantastic Four #7 and Ex Machina #7.  UFF(Ultimate Fantastic Four) #7 marks the start of Warren Ellis' and Stuart Immonen's run.  Ellis writes a lot of great books (Planetary and Transmetropolitan were my favorites).  

Ex Machina is a new book by Brian Vaughan (Y: The Last Man, Ultimate X-Men) and Tony Harris.  So far, the story is interesting, but there was one thing that seemed a bit off.  Mitchell seemed to throw the word _fuck_ around a bit much for the NYC mayor.  Anyhow, this looks like it'll be fun.

Also, Amazing Spider-Man #508 concludes the Ezekial storyline that's been running throughout JMS's run.  I was feeling a bit lost with all the supernatural stuff and missing kids and all that, but this wrapped all that up nicely.  

Other purchases today include Ultimate Spider-Man #61, Seaguy #2, Human Target #11, Daredevil #61, and Challengers of the Unknown #1.
