title: my video card is bigger than yours
---
Nvidia announced the GeForce 6800.  Look at how it "demolishes":http://www.hardwareanalysis.com/content/article/1708.8/ the Radeon 9800 in Halo and Far Cry.  And, look at how big the thing is!  Not only does it take up an AGP _and_ a PCI slot (commonplace in high-end video cards), but it has two power connectors on it.  

Any chance of an ultra-lite GeForce Go version for laptops?
