title: new ajax features in ruby on rails
---
Thomas Fuchs shows off some cool AJAX features.  Instead of providing demos, he provides a small quicktime clip demonstrating them.  First is an "autocompleting textbox on steroids":http://mir.aculo.us/th0fu/autocompleting-text-fields-on-steroids/view.  Then, there's the "file upload with a progress bar":http://mir.aculo.us/th0fu/so-where-is-the-progress-bar/view.  I hope these patches make it into Rails, or at least are available as simple addons.

*Update:*  There's a demo page showing off the "new javascript effects":http://mir.aculo.us/demos/effects/demo1.html that will be included in the next version of Rails.  Effect.Puff is especially nice...
