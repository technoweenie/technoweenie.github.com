Oh man, [@xinuc](http://twitter.com/xinuc/status/13714721161) is breaking my heart over here.  The name Rhodes is taken by [some javascript mobile phone framework](http://github.com/rhomobile/rhodes).  Now, I need a new name.  I'm leaning towards Noh-Varr if no one else has any suggestions.

*Update:* Okay, [Jed rocks](http://twitter.com/jedschmidt/status/13716191470), the new project's name will be [nori](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nori).
