Wow, I've been accepted onto the "rails core team":http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/articles/2006/03/05/rick-olson-joins-the-rails-core.  Thanks for the kind words, everyone.  I'm just grateful that I can contribute back to the Rails community.

And to celebrate, I wrote a new (soon-to-be) plugin: "acts_as_draftable":http://techno-weenie.net/svn/projects/mephisto/trunk/lib/acts_as_draftable.rb.
