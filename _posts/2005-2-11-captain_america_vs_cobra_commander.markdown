title: captain america vs. cobra commander
---
Does anyone else think that this new "Captain America villain":http://marvel.com/wallpaper/papers/cap_am_6_800.jpg (or he may be an old one, I'm not up on my Captain America trivia) looks like a "Cobra Commander":http://www.littlelostrobot.com/cobra.htm wearing that weird hat from "the Cosby Kids":http://www.toonopedia.com/fatalbrt.htm?

Ed Brubaker is the first writer to get me to actually read Captain America.  The previous relaunch didn't do much for me (the beautiful art by John Cassaday couldn't save it).  Then, there's "Cap-Wolf":http://www.medinnus.com/winghead/cap_1/cap_01_408.jpg.
