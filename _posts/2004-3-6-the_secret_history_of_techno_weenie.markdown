title: the secret history of techno weenie
---
h4. the birth

My first weblog was titled _cranial disorder_, and went live on July 1st, 1998.  It was written by hand, and was my outlet for whatever I was feeling on whatever particular day.  

It was left behind that November when I enlisted into the military.  For the next six months or so, I was effectively cut off from the internet.  

h4. the return

Upon my glorious return, I came back to a completely different landscape.  I was offered generous hosting by "Stuart":http://www.hearye.org/ for my renamed site _techno weenie_.  It was great to be back, but I had a lot of catching up to do.  Then, Stu introduced me to these things called PHP and MySQL.  techno weenie went through several homebrew backends as I discovered a new side of me.

h4. change

I outgrew my old home and needed some breathing room, so I moved my hosting to "phpwebhosting":http://phpwebhosting.com and started work on "Supasite"http://freshmeat.net/projects/supasite/, my PHP blog engine.  It was fun to work on, but the birth of my son kind of made it difficult to work on.  So, I had to drop it.  

I used "Radio Userland":http://radio.userland.com for a bit (the outliner stuff was nifty), but finally settled on "Movable Type":http://www.movabletype.org/ for my needs.

h4. current

Other than brief hints here and there, I keep my personal life out of _techno weenie_.  This is just an extension of the geek side of me.
