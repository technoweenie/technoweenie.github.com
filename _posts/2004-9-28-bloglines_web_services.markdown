title: Bloglines Web Services
---
Bloglines released documentation of their "Web Services":http://bloglines.com/services/.  It's a simple REST interface that returns RSS 2.0 entries, OPML blogrolls, and a count of unread entries.  

This offers blogroll and entry synchronization among multiple computers.  Now, I'm thinking about moving back to FeedDemon.  I originally left because Bloglines allowed me to read my news on the go.  Offline reading was out of the question.  And no matter what improvements Bloglines has and will make, the UI isn't near what a desktop GUI can provide.  

Now, imagine if the Bloglines API was open.  Then, instead of adding a Bloglines Channel Group in FeedDemon, you would add a generic server-based Channel group using the same API.  Community based aggregators could provide news to their members through online syncing or a web based interface.  This sounds an awful lot like Usenet...

I went to download FeedDemon 1.5 beta this morning, and came across this announcement of "NewsGator integration":http://nick.typepad.com/blog/2004/09/ann_feeddemon_1_1.html.  I wonder how similar the two APIs are?
