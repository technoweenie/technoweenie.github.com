title: Screencast of the new administration interface
---
I whipped up a "quick screencast":http://techno-weenie.net/files/administration/admin_demo.swf.html of what my administration code below does.  Please excuse my awkward typing, I'm not used to coding rails on Windows and gvim.  I used "CamStudio":http://www.camstudio.org/ to create the video, which is windows only.  It's free, and it compressed my 76MB AVI file to a 6MB flash file.  Very nice.
