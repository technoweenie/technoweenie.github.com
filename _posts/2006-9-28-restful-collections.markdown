title: RESTful Collections
---
bq. "The idea of RESTful "Collections", i.e. doing CRUD over HTTP correctly, has been percolating for years now. A Collection is nothing more than a list, a container for resources. While the APP defines a Collection in terms of Atom Feed and Entry documents we don't have to be limited to that." -- "Joe Gregorio":http://bitworking.org/news/wsgicollection

Joe implemented "wsgicollection":http://bitworking.org/projects/wsgicollection/, a little library that allows you to write restful apps in the style of "simply_restful":http://weblog.rubyonrails.com/2006/8/1/simply-restful-in-rails-edge rails apps.
