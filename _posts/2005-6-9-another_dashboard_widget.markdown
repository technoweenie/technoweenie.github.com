title: another dashboard widget

I know I just posted about how little I use the Dashboard, but I just caught wind of a great widget for you Ruby on Rails (or just plain Ruby) developers.  David Felstead just posted about his "RDoc Repository widget":http://widgets.precisionis.com.au/ to the RoR mailing list.  Great stuff.
