bq. "Synergy":http://synergy2.sourceforge.net/ lets you easily share a single mouse and keyboard between multiple computers with different operating systems, each with its own display, without special hardware. It's intended for users with multiple computers on their desk since each system uses its own monitor(s).

I've "posted on this before":http://techno-weenie.net/blog/code/203/automating-deployment-with-subversion, but "Synergy":http://synergy2.sourceforge.net/ rocks.  I've noticed some issues with the back/forward mouse buttons (buttons 4 and 5), and the windows key on the client machine.  I feel helpless without the windows key.
