It's just an annoying splash page, but I can't get over the "MegaManEffect":http://mikezornek.com/cocoa/megamaneffect/.  Apparently my next miniboss is TextMate...

I have "color coded terminal logins":http://www.dreness.com/phpbb/viewtopic.php?p=18& now.  no more staying logged into textdrive for long periods of time...
