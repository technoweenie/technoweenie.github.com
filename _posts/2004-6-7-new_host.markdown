I recently registered new web space at "Host Department":http://hostdepartment.com/ for a super-secret ASP.Net -vaporware- project, and today they tripled my disk space and transfer for free.  For $10 (the Premium Application 500 package) I get 1.5 GB storage and 30GB transfer.  Gigabytes are cheap these days, and everyone is bumping up their email storage, but the increase in bandwidth really shocks me.
