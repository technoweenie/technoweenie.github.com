title: "New to the CAN: Widget, json fixes, etc"

I just pushed a new version the [Calendar About Nothing](http://calendaraboutnothing.com):

* [mtah](http://github.com/mtah) fixed a problem with the JSON routes.  Gah, [totally my fault](http://www.sinatrarb.com/testing.html).
* [jqr](http://github.com/jqr) cleaned things up a little, patching broken windows, etc.  One really nice thing: he fixed a [potential infinite loop in feed processing](http://github.com/entp/seinfeld/commit/685f80388cd5953595135e9e7fef862233f17292).
* Kalin Harvey added a [capfile](http://www.capify.org/).
* [kastner](http://github.com/kastner made a [swanky new iPhone/iPod touch icon](http://calendaraboutnothing.com/apple-touch-icon.png).

And the big update:

* [lachlanhardy](http://github.com/lachlanhardy) wrote a jQuery widget so you can post the calendar to your site. 

Thanks for the updates, everyone.

Also, I've been working with the Heroku guys on getting the weird intermittent server error on [IsLOSTOnYet](http://islostonyet.com/) up and running.  I think [it's fixed now](http://github.com/technoweenie/islostonyet.com/commit/2c01ff6d3f73c8d63e664808c05bef0861a2bf0a).
