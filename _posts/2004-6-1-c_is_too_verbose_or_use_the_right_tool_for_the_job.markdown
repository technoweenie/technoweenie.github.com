title: C# is too verbose (or use the right tool for the job)

"17 lines of c# to 1 line of VB.Net":http://dotnetjunkies.com/WebLog/grant.killian/archive/2004/06/01/14946.aspx

The fault in that situation isn't necessarily c#.  The developers of the VSTO(Visual Studio Tools for Office) obviously favored VB.Net.  It seems like there are some fairly simple things one could do to cater to c# just a bit (operator overloads for example?).
