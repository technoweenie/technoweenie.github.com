Firefox 1.0PR is out.  This update has a few improvements, but the most noticeable is its Atom/RSS support.  "Live Bookmarks":http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/live-bookmarks.html display syndicated feeds as a folder of links.  

Combine it with a bookmarking service like "del.icio.us":http://del.icio.us/ and you can share the latest bookmarks (or view others' bookmarks).  

Also, I've been kicking around some ideas.  Right now I have three information stores feeding this site:  the main blog, my quickies sidebar, and my comics photostream.  I'd like to try merging them into a singular feed for the homepage.  I could style each item according to what it is (blog entry, quickie link, photo).  

I'm really interested in "Leslie Orchard's":http://decafbad.com/ "feedReactor":http://www.decafbad.com/kwiki/index.cgi?FeedReactor.  Sounds like something right up my alley.
