title: Sentry encryption library
---
I investigated ruby encryption methods last night and needed a quick way to encrypt and decrypt data with an asymmetrical algorithm.  I came up with "Sentry":http://rafb.net/paste/results/OgBtAz99.html, and posted more about it "at my work blog":http://weblog.digett.com/2005/07/06/sentry-encryption-library/
