title: knee-jerk conspiracy theories

Thankfully, "Joel's fears about Lookout's acquisition":http://joelonsoftware.com/items/2004/07/19.html were unfounded.  It took a few days, but Lookout v1.2 is a "free download":http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=09b835ee-16e5-4961-91b8-2200ba31ea37&displaylang=en. 

Lookout is amazing if you're like me and are _forced_ to use it.  For personal email, I use gmail, and I hear Google has some prior search and index experience.

Anyways, Lookout is brought to you by "Lucene.Net":http://sourceforge.net/projects/lucenedotnet, a c# port of the "Jakarta Lucene":http://jakarta.apache.org/lucene/docs/index.html Java search engine library.  There's also a Python port called "Lupy":http://www.divmod.org/Home/Projects/Lupy/index.html.  See,  good searching can be easy and fun!"
