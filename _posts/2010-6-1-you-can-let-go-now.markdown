If you're reading this, I've completed migrating my blog from [Mephisto](http://github.com/technoweenie/mephisto)
to [Jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll).  

I had fun working on it, but clearly I failed on being able to foster a good community around it.  It was an unconventional Rails app in a time before things like Rack, Sinatra, MongoDB, restful controllers, etc.  It's nice to see similar ideas in newer projects though:

* [Jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll)
* [Harmony](http://get.harmonyapp.com/)
* [Wheat](http://github.com/creationix/wheat)

Thanks to everyone who [helped work on it](http://github.com/technoweenie/mephisto/contributors), especially [Justin](http://alternateidea.com/) for the partnership on the design.  Mephisto was where our working relationship started, which eventually lead to Lighthouse and ENTP...
