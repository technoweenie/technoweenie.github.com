"Casshern":http://casshern.com/ was amazing.  It's a remake on a 35 year-old anime series.  Apparently, it may even be "released in the US":http://www.themovieblog.com/archives/2004/04/casshern_coming_to_america.html, in the original form and a US remake by the same director.  

I'm surprised at how little US press this movie got.  Sky Captain received so much based on its special effects, but it's not the only movie made this year like that.  Casshern utilizes a variety of visual styles, all very impressive, and has a decent story.
