title: the search toolbar wars

I was just wondering, which toolbar gets to block the popup when you have "multiple toolbars loaded":http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=9ea74169-05c2-44dd-a5cf-6a892933df14?

My personal pick right now is the MSN Toolbar.  Yes, I feel dirty.  But for months I've been using Lookout to quickly find source code, and this is the next logical upgrade.  

Now, if it had the extensibility of "Dave's Quick Search Taskbar":http://www.dqsd.net/, it would be a huge winner with me.
