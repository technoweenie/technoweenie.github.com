title: where's my inspiration
---
it's odd where one gets inspiration from sometimes.  sometimes, all it takes is the right "font":http://www.robotjohnny.com/fontpage.html and just a little bit of artistic vision (if you could call it that).

this layout was written in mozilla's edit css extension while listening to some NOFX.  let me know if you experience some weirdness.
