title: Released Rails bits
---
"Dan":http://hivelogic.com and "Dan":http://simplebits.com released their collaboration: "Cork'd":http://corkd.com/ for wine reviewing and tagging.  I'm not a wine drinker by any means, but it is a _beautiful_ little app.

Nathaniel Talbott released a "Query Trace plugin":http://blog.talbott.ws/articles/2006/05/17/querytrace-my-first-official-rails-plugin for pinpointing exactly where in your code those pesky ActiveRecord queries are executed.

Finally, Dan Webb released a "Request Routing plugin":http://svn.vivabit.net/external/rubylibs/request_routing/README.  This lets you filter routes based on properties in the Request object: subdomain, domain, method, port, remote_ip, content_type, accepts, request_uri, protocol.
