I had the pleasure of catching "Squarepusher":http://www.warprecords.com live last Wednesday in Austin.  Awesome.  Cassetteboy was... interesting.  (I didn't find any online reviews, but there is a "Cassetteboy / Squarepusher":http://www.themilkfactory.co.uk/features/hmsp.htm review from London, with pictures).

I also saw the Punisher movie.  Awesome.
