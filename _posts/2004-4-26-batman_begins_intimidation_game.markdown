Looks like I'm not the only one excited about the new Batman flick.  "Allan":http://www.livejournal.com/users/alienhate/ got his hands on the "rumored Batman Begins script":http://www.google.com/search?q=batman+begins+script&start=10 and says "it looks pretty good":http://www.livejournal.com/users/alienhate/49239.html.

(I'm using this entry to test "Bloglines' new References feature":http://www.bloglines.com/about/news#56.  It reminds me of "SharpReader's threading feature":http://www.hutteman.com/weblog/2003/04/07-57.html.)
