title: training the system administrator

bq. <em>"One of my bugaboos is when software knows something bad has to happen but doesn't tell anyone.  So you find out *after* processing has ground to a halt that the database you *thought* had a simple recovery plan, in fact, has a full recovery plan, and that explains why the transaction log file has swallowed all the available space on your D: partition, and now is just sitting there, sweating, looking like a morbidly obese anaconda that just swallowed Michael Moore and is too nauseated even to upchuck.  Question:  If the DBMS knew you were approaching the end of your rope, why didn't it say something?  My working hypothesis is that it's kind of like when your wife wants you to take out the trash, but all she says is, “The trash can is almost full.“  Not, “Honey, will you please take out the trash?“  Her objective is not to get you to take out the trash; rather, it is to improve you, the husband, morally and spiritually -- while at the same time getting you to take out the trash.  You're supposed to infer, based on the facts she's provided, that you need to do it.  I say, this is more like training than housekeeping.  My wife insists that she must therefore be a very poor trainer.  But trust me, she's keeping score."</em> -- "Lee Dise's SQL Server Blog":http://weblogs.sqlteam.com/leed/archive/2004/07/27/1798.aspx
