title: Using the MeasureMap Date Slider
---
I really liked the "date slider":http://www.measuremap.com/developer/slider/ and decided to "make a little video":http://rails.techno-weenie.net/tip/2006/1/10/using_the_measuremap_date_slider showing how to integrate it into an app.  I'm not so great with the audio as you can tell.  Perhaps next time I'll use stickies like "Florian did":http://blog.oaklandcutlery.com/articles/2005/10/19/faster-tdd-with-rails.
