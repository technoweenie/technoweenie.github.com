"Monoppix":http://weblogs.asp.net/jgalloway/archive/2004/09/01/223945.aspx is a version of the popular knoppix linux boot disk, with mono and XSP development support built in.  Great for quickly testing mono's ASP.Net support in linux.  Originally reported by "Sanjay":http://sastools.com/b2/post/79394279 straight from the bleeding edge.
