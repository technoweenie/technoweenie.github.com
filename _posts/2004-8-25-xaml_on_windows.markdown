The "Longhorn XAML demos":http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdntv/episode.aspx?xml=episodes/en/20031028LHORNDB/manifest.xml were amazing, but I haven't been paying too much attention.  The platform's not due out for a couple years, and I'm mostly an ASP.Net guy.

"Xamlon":http://www.xamlon.com is a XAML engine for .Net 1.x applications, so you can start using it today.  I can't say how accurate it is to Longhorn XAML, but it's still very interesting.
