title: are you an apple fanboy?
---
I created "IsItFakeOrNot.com":http://isitfakeornot.com as a place to come together and discuss those apple rumors we all can't seem to stop talking about.  It's just a tiny app I threw together over the last few nights while playing around with some new edge rails stuff.  The site came about after some offhanded comment that "Thomas":http://mir.aculo.us/ made.  He supplied the design, and I wrote the ruby codes.

Anyways, don't take the site _too_ seriously, we're all just messing around :)  Happy "Programmer's Day":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmer's_day everyone!
