title: the xml button problem
---
Dave "doesn't like those XML subscribe buttons":http://www.reallysimplesyndication.com/2005/01/12#a254 (Okay, he doesn't like competitors' buttons, since he still has a Radio Userland coffee mug from when he was still with them).  

But, the solution he suggests doesn't really help.  He's suggesting a centralized blogrolling facility that provides OPML to the aggregators. Wonderful, more buttons.  What does this solve exactly? 

It's odd that for *every other* common file type downloaded by the browser, you select a default application.  Why can't it be this simple with RSS?  

Joe "shows the way":http://bitworking.org/news/Atom_Auto_Sub_How_To, with a couple tiny apps in linux and windows.  The same technique could easily be adopted by RSS.
