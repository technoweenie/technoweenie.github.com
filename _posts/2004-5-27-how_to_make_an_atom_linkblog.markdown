title: how to make an atom linkblog
---
I see a lot of possibilities in Atom that make the XML geek in me happy, but the tools are still evolving.  

Mark writes about "how his linkblog works":http://diveintomark.org/archives/2004/05/27/howto-atom-linkblog.  I was trying for the same thing on my "blogger linkblog":http://www.techno-weenie.net/quickie/, but it didn't create the Atom the correct way.  If I put an external link in blogger's "link" field, it doesn't show up in the Atom file.  Therefore, my linkblog was only linking to itself.

Now, I don't see blogger adding fields for _related_ or _via_ links anytime soon, so I may hack something together for my own use.
