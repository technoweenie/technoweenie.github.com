title: Rails Weenie Oddness
---
I started getting some reports of errors on Rails Weenie.  Apparently I kicked the rails version up without fixing my has_many :through associations.  I just updated Rails Weenie with the first real changes I've made in awhile.  I've decided to do away with the sidebar on the articles and the annoying InPlaceEditor stuff.  It's still far from perfect, but I'll be tweaking it this weekend.  I just wasn't planning on deploying this morning...

Yes, I seriously need error pages and the exception notifier plugin for this...
