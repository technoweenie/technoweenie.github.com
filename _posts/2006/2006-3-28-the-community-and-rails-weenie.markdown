title: The community and Rails Weenie
---
If one good thing came out of Amy Hoy's "Help Vampires":http://slash7.com/pages/vampires article (I don't count vampire and Buffy puns to be good either), it's the amount of dialog it has inspired.  Of course, this means there is some renewed interest in Rails Weenie.  I've been a bad community leader in this regard, watching the "Rails Weenie tickets lay stagnant":http://collaboa.techno-weenie.net/tickets/filter?part=4&status=1 and generally being distracted by other things.

Anyways, if you'd like to pitch in, the svn is at "http://techno-weenie.net/svn/projects/rails_help":http://techno-weenie.net/svn/projects/rails_help.  I hope you're okay with the MIT license for everything.  Here are a few things:

* Remove the In-Place-Editor and have a real edit form.  
* Add tagging as a way to categorize entries
* Ratings for entries
* Listings of top questions, users, etc
* Hyper-Estraier search indexing

None of this is even that difficult.  I could knock out the majority of that during a good hackfest.  I still like the I Am Rice theme, but I really need a better way to organize this information.

I do have some plans beyond Rails Weenie, so I may be forking at some point.  I'm not quite sure how I want to deal with that yet.
