title: acts as authenticated documentation
---
After using acts_as_authenticated a few times, I find myself removing all those extra comments.  You know, all that "extra credit" that I included.  So, I've barely started moving that onto a wiki page of its own.  When it's all done, I want the plugin to be as lean as possible, with all extra recipes documented on the "Acts as Authenticated wiki":http://technoweenie.stikipad.com/plugins/show/Acts+as+Authenticated or "Rails Weenie":http://rails.techno-weenie.net/tip/2006/3/27/integrating_the_account_location_plugin_with_acts_as_authenticated.
