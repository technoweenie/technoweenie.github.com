"Mongrel 0.3.13 is out":http://mongrel.rubyforge.org/news.html.  This is a *huge* release for Mongrel, one that lets me finish up my upload progress gemplugin.  I've been running both this weblog (single mongrel/Mephisto) and "Rails Weenie":http://rails.techno-weenie.net (2 load balanced mongrels) for weeks without any real hitches.  They're both on the latest Mongrel now.

During Railsday, I deployed "Bloction":http://bloction.railsmachina.com to my beta "Rails Machine":http://railsmachine.com account.  The "Getting Started":https://support.railsmachine.com/index.php?pg=kb.chapter&id=8 had me up in running in about 30 minutes total.  It all seemed like PFM(pure fucking magic) to a server administration neophyte like myself.
