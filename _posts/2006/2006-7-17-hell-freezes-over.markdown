Now that I've actually written some documention on using one of my plugins: "Acts as Attachment":http://weblog.techno-weenie.net/articles/acts_as_attachment.  This is a little experiment for me, to see if I can actually write useful stuff.  

For Mephisto geeks, I've written the articles as two posts attached to two sections: 'articles', and 'articles/acts_as_attachment'.  You can go to "/articles":/articles to see the latest updates, or subscribe to its own "feed":http://weblog.techno-weenie.net/feed/articles/atom.xml.
