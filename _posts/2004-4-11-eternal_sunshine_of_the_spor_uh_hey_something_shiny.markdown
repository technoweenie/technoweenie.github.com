"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind":http://www.eternalsunshine.com/ was a wonderful movie.  Twisted.  Disorienting.  Human.  Of course, "the idea of erasing your significant other from your memory is absurd":http://slate.msn.com/id/2097502/ (though, I'll probably eat these words from the Wayback Machine in 200 years when my head is floating in a jar with my _bright, peaceful_ memories of 2004).
