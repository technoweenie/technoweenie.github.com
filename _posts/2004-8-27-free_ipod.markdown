Apparently, the "FreeIpods":http://www.freeiPods.com/default.aspx?referer=8404268 scam is "legit":http://www.engadget.com/entry/1771223899144212/.  

The company gets money from all the people signing up for ipods.  The people that sign up with no referrer, sign up as the 6th or greater referral for someone, or don't have five friends are basically 'freebies' for the company.  

Pretty good plot, I hope I get an Ipod out of this.  And if you're thinking of signing up, use "http://www.freeiPods.com/default.aspx?referer=8404268":http://www.freeiPods.com/default.aspx?referer=8404268 and help a guy out.
