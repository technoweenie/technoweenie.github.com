title: Where did rick go?
---
I'm finding it difficult to come up with a use for this blog.  Most of my work is spent on client work or Lighthouse, so therefore my rails based blogging is at the "Active Reload blog":http://activereload.net/blog.  Mephisto has its "own blog":http://mephistoblog.com/ of course, but a fair amount of you still can't access it (Registerfly has my domains locked and untransferrable, I may have to bite the bullet and buy a new name.).

I'm also having a lot of fun with "my tumblr":http://technoweenie.tumblr.com/.  Even though I can technically do everything there in Mephisto, Tumblr provides a nice, focused interface for tumbling.  I've pretty much ceased my twitter activity lately, I can't imagine it was anything exciting to read.  I'd like to turn this blog into more of a dashboard with various feeds for my OSS projects and blogs.  It'd give me a chance to beef up that aspect of Mephisto as well...

As for offline activities, I'm teaching my son to be a Guitar Hero and getting him prepped for kindergarten graduation (don't ask).
