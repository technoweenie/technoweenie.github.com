Happy New Year, and all that usual shit people say to each other.  I hope everyone had a great holiday vacation, and will be ready to come back next week **supercharged**.  Hopefully you're ready to [start some new habits](http://gilesbowkett.blogspot.com/2008/12/no-new-language-in-2009-new-habits.html) or [continue your old ones](http://calendaraboutnothing.com/).

You may notice some tweaks with the [CalendarAboutNothing](http://calendaraboutnothing.com/) now, by the way.  Github tweaked the feeds, and now push events for non-master branches are shown in the events.  Some people noticed that they were missing X's for days with pushes, so I re-scanned everyone's history.  If you've deleted a repository with a substantial number of commits, those days may now be empty (sorry [matt](http://calendaraboutnothing.com/~mattly)!).  I've also added some debug code  that should clue me into what causes the large jumps in streaks.  Hopefully I can get that stupid bug squashed soon.
