title: automatic linux updates
---
I recently loaded "Fedora Core 2":http://fedora.redhat.com/ on my spare computer.  Besides just sitting there as a Samba server for my laptop, I've decided to load PHP 5 on it and play around.  

One important aspect is keeping my packages updated.  up2date is nice, and has a readily available icon on the taskbar, but it keeps hanging on me on certain packages.  So, I found some "yum tutorials":http://fedoranews.org/tchung/howto/2003-11-09-yum-intro.shtml and used it.  Command-line based, and it works.
