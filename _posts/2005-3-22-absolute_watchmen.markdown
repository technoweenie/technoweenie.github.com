title: Absolute Watchmen

"Watchmen is being reprinted as a hardcover":http://www.newsarama.com/forums/showthread.php?s=&threadid=29994.  I picked up Absolute Planetary recently, and loved the larger hardback format.  

bq. Announced at today’s “Beyond the DC Universe” panel at WizardWorld LA was the next addition to DC’s very successful “Absolute” line this fall: Absolute Watchmen. The new edition of the classic Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons story is currently being adapted to the larger, “Absolute” format and recolored by original colorist John Higgins. The edition is being produced with the blessing of Alan Moore.

"Sin City's been doing great":http://icv2.com/articles/home/6600.html, but why were the trades rereleased in these smaller, digest versions?  It's cool that the actual comic can serve as the "movie adaptation," rather then getting some "crappy":http://www.shinyshelf.co.uk/article/sl/st/280 "movie":http://www.dccomics.com/comics/?cm=2515 "adaptation":http://www.hillcity-comics.com/graphic_novels/new_graphic_novel2798.htm loosly based on the actual comic series.
