bq. Paramount has "bought the film rights to 'Invincible,'":http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117918750?categoryid=13&cs=1 the teen superhero Image Comics series by writer Robert Kirkman, who's been all over the comics biz lately with "The Walking Dead" and plenty of work for Marvel, including "Marvel Team Up." Kirkman will write the screenplay — his first — and the pic will be produced by "Constantine's" Lorenzo Di Bonaventura and Circle of Confusion partner David Alpert.

Awesome.  Invincible is one of my favorite comics out right now.  It's good, clean superhero fun.  I'm hoping they cover the big twist at the end of the first year without spoiling it in the trailers.
