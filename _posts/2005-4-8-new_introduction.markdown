I've been blogging in some form since 1998, but I've always refrained from putting out a public image.  That's just my nature, I suppose, but today I'm trying something new.  I recently started working at a local firm doing ASP.Net development.  Naturally, I wanted to blog about what I was doing, but I felt it would be better if I could blog somewhere that adds some value and credibility to my firm.  techno weenie will stay around of course, but will stay focused on my personal projects.

So, let's start over.

Hi, I'm Rick Olson, an ASP.Net developer for "Digett":http://digett.com.  Welcome to my personal blog.
