title: Super JumpDrive

Recently I caved in and purchased a 256MB Lexar JumpDrive.  I got tired of leeching my friend's anytime I needed to move some files.  Since it has a key ring on the wrong side (I'd rather snap the JumpDrive off the keychain, than plugging it in with my keys hanging off of it), I was wondering how long it'd be before I lost it.

Instead, I left it in a pair of pants and ran it through the washer and dryer.  The amazing thing... it _still works_.  Give those engineers a raise.

Anyone want to make any bets on how long it lasts now?
