Blogger "relaunched":http://www.blogger.com/knowledge/2004/05/great-blogger-relaunch.pyra, in the biggest change since they were acquired by Google.  "Douglas Bowman":http://www.stopdesign.com/log/2004/05/09/blogger.html and "Jeffrey Veen":http://www.veen.com/jeff/archives/000533.html both have writeups related to the relaunch.  

I'm pretty impressed with it all.  This, coupled with "Art Direction and the Web":http://alistapart.com/articles/artdirweb/ ["A List Apart":http://alistapart.com/], really highlights the difference between art and design.  I find that I have very little artistic creativity when it comes to this, which is why I prefer the programming aspect (did you notice the hideous layout this site is sporting?).
