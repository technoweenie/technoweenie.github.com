title: Rails 0.10.0

"Rails 0.10.0 is out":http://weblog.rubyonrails.com/archives/2005/02/24/rails-0100-routing-web-services-components-oracle/.  Notable new features include Routing (get nice looking, custom URLs without mod_rewrite), "Action Web Services":http://aws.rubyonrails.com/ (check out the "MetaWeblog example":http://dev.rubyonrails.com/file/trunk/actionwebservice/examples/metaWeblog/blog_controller.rb) with WSDL support, and "Components":http://manuals.rubyonrails.com/read/book/14.  

Too bad it broke my rails app, though I was expecting this.  It is possible to "freeze your rails version":http://weblog.textdrive.com/article/30/routing-an-upcoming-change-in-rubyonrails though.
