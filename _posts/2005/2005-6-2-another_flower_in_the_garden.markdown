"Chiseled Flower":http://postsomnia.com/chiseled-flower is another _structured wiki_ written in Rails. I love the main philosophy behind it:

* Any page can 'publish' to any other page; I call the receiving page the 'subscriber'.
* Pages can determine what to do with their subscriptions (not implemented yet).
* Subscriptions are the ONLY hierarchy along which pages are organized. Otherwise, all pages are equal. This is partly inspired by "hugh's software question":http://www.gapingvoid.com/Moveable_Type/archives/001573.html, and partly driven by my own curiosity and interest in folksonomies.
* Pages are organized along the lines of a "backpack":http://backpackit.com/ page. File uploads and image attachments are forthcoming.
* All pages offer a syndicated feed of their contents.

Interesting.  Must check out later.
