I just finished reading Joel's dead tree version of "Joel on Software":http://joelonsoftware.com/navLinks/BuytheBooks.html.  Even though I've read most, if not all, of the articles, they were definitely worth another read.  

Plus, it's in a format that you can read in the bathroom that "doesn't affect your fertility":http://my.webmd.com/content/article/98/104676.htm?z=1728_00000_1000_nb_01.
