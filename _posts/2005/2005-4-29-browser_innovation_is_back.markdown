title: browser innovation is back

Looks like Mozilla is "turning on the _canvas_ element":https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=288714#c50, an upcoming "WhatWG":http://www.whatwg.org/ standard.

bq. "Do you have any idea how big this is? It is totally huge. Not the element itself, but the fact that developers are finally getting over playing follow-the-leader to Microsoft and the W3C and getting on with the job of innovating. I'm looking forward to a new age of incremental innovation." -- "Joe Gregorio":http://bitworking.org/news/ (sorry, his permalink is conflicting with Textile...)

Yes, that's great.  Safari and Firefox are also starting to implement some CSS3 features, such as "multi-column support":http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/roc/archives/2005/03/gecko_18_for_we.html.  But, how useful is this really unless you happen to run a safari/firefox-centric website?  

I guess it's my duty as a web developer to use next-generation web functionality and only worry about not crashing IE6.
