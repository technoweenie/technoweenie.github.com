title: multiple blogs for your split personalities
---
Even Jeffrey Zeldman <a href="http://www.zeldman.com/daily/0405b.shtml">has a separate blog</a>.  

bq. It is liberating to be just another blogger. To use someone else’s template design, someone else’s publishing system, and someone else’s plain old industry-standard blog site architecture. To grab photos from flickr, post hurried remarks, and watch smart or snarky comments roll in.

Categories were supposed to allow us to blog _anything_ we wanted, while the visitors could read just the items they cared about.  Maybe it's more then having different themed posts over the same template.  Maybe it helps to have a whole separate blog with its own theme music and mood lighting.

I will soon be joining the ranks of the schizophrenic bloggers when my corporate blog goes live.  It'll be a lot like this blog, but geared towards my job, and will not contain the word "motherfucker":http://diveintomark.org/archives/2004/08/11/corporate-blogging (or as Jason Fried likes to say, the "F-bomb":http://www.37signals.com/svn/archives/000965.php#jf_035492).

Actually, we're not very corporate.  But, I'm just trying to create an air of mystery around our launch.  There will be a change to this blog too (I keep saying that, but this time I mean it!).  Stay tuned...
