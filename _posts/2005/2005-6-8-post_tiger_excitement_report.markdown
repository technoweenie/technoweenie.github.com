title: post-Tiger excitement report
---
So, I've had Tiger for a little, so what's the verdict?  It still runs fine on my Mac Mini (with 1GB RAM).  A lot of people claimed it was faster, but I haven't found that to be the case necessarily.  I'm still happily chugging along with my ruby on rails development.

However, I find myself ignoring Spotlight and Dashboard, the two main Tiger features.  Spotlight gets pretty poor results for me.  I'm learning how to use "Quicksilver":http://quicksilver.blacktree.com/ even better, though.  The only dashboard widgets I use are "Flidget":http://www.dashboardwidgets.com/showcase/details.php?wid=204 and "ShowOff":http://jokke.dk/software/.  Though, I'd love it if I could find a password manager, similar to "KeePass":http://keepass.sourceforge.net/.
