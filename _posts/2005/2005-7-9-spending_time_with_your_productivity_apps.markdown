One thing I really picked up from the "new Ruby on Rails movie":http://weblog.rubyonrails.com/archives/2005/07/08/new-rails-movie-with-sound-and-sugar/ was David's use of the TextMate shortcuts.  If you were watching close, you'd see he'd type some little code, and whoops, he has a new class definition, for loop, link_to call, etc.  It looked like lag from the video feed, but he was really using a "TextMate Bundle":http://macromates.com/wiki/pmwiki?n=Main.Bundles.  

I've actually known for awhile that these exist, but I was still pretty new with TextMate to dive into them.  What's really cool, is that the TextMate author didn't define any strict API to follow, other than the format the bundles are saved in (the Bundle Editor helps with that htough).  It looks like the commands just pipe input to unix commands and return the results somehow.
