bq. _It's a collection of Java Best Practices rewritten in a 'cool' geeky language. Nothing new...._

bq. Here's one more Java Best Practice: Avoid expensive, complex application server software, and do rapid development using the Web server that is built into the standard library. Then deploy to the Web server of choice with no code changes or quirky vendor-specific API hacks.
