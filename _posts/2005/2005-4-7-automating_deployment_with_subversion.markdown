title: automating deployment with subversion
---
"Ars":http://arstechnica.com/columns/linux/linux-20050406.ars hooks us up with some nice linux tips.  First, Adam Israel goes into Subversion hooks, a way to run shell scripts during various events.  For instance, you can deploy your website as soon as a new revision is commited.  I'll definitely look into this...

Next, he mentioned "Synergy":http://synergy2.sourceforge.net/index.html.

bq. Synergy lets you easily share a single mouse and keyboard between multiple computers with different operating systems, each with its own display, without special hardware. It's intended for users with multiple computers on their desk since each system uses its own monitor(s).

I've heard of this before I think, but I wasn't in the situation that I needed it.  I need this now, though.
