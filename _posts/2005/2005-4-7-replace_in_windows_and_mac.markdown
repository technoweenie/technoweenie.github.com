title: "'replace' in windows and mac"
---
bq. "Unsurprisingly, I dislike Windows’ “merge when replacing folders” behavior. The main reason is that when you replace a file with a same-named file, Windows does the same thing the Mac does: it deletes the old copy and replaces it with the new one. It’s a terrible idea for “replacing” to mean two entirely different things, depending solely on what it is you’re replacing." -- "John Gruber":http://daringfireball.net/2005/04/replace

I never thought of it that way.  Yet, I still like the Windows way better.  Maybe because I haven't used a Mac since high school (I *hated* those things), and I've been a Windows guy since.  It's one of those things... I can't imagine living without a two-button + scroll wheel mouse either.

Does the Mac have a 'merge' option?
