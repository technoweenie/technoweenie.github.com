title: railsday is over
---
My "RailsDay":http://railsday.com/ project was "tally!":http://tally.dpiddy.net/ ("subversion repository":http://railsday.com/svn/railsday3/trunk/), built with my co-conspirators "Dan Peterson":http://piece.dpiddy.net/ and Casey Gollan (blog coming someday? what?).  tally is our little "social polling" app.  Create polls, answer them, and so on.  I really think our rapid fire! mode is great.  Just cycle through your unanswered polls and finish them off one-by-one.  

I know that everyone involved had a great time, so I fully expect that tally! will be moved to a more permanent spot in the very near future.  

I'm beat, but I'll probably write more about the experience later.  Right now, I'd just like to thank my two partners.  Can't believe we actually pulled it off.  A huge thanks to "Lucas Carlson":http://tech.rufy.com/ for organizing the whole thing.
