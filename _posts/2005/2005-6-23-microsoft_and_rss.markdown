Microsoft is extending RSS and "including Dave Winer in the conversation":http://www.reallysimplesyndication.com/2005/06/22#a634.  That's all well and good, really.  It'd be nice to see this kind of forward momentum with HTML standards.  How about implementing "some proposed HTML 5 features":http://www.ajaxian.com/archives/2005/06/html_5_vs_xhtml.html as they get implemented in other browsers?  How about some CSS 3 love?
