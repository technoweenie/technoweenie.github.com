i hope everyone had a good, safe holiday.  

I have a feeling big changes are in store for this blog.  Ever since getting on "del.icio.us":http://del.icio.us/, I find that my posts are rare since most of my "content" is borrowed links.  

So, I'm still trying to figure this out.  techno weenie may devolve into a link blog.  But, my ultimate goal of selling a techno weenie t-shirt may never be realized.  How cool would it be to get a custom t like "daring fireball":http://daringfireball.net/members/tshirt?
