title: helping the rails newbies out
---
One of the problems with being the hot new web development platform, is the influx of newbies needing help.  It doesn't matter who you are, but it gets tiring answering some of the same questions over and over again.

"Rails Weenie":http://rails.techno-weenie.net is my attempt to make this situation a little more interesting.  Sign up and you start off with five points.  Offer up points for questions.  Answer other questions to get more points.  

I'm sure you'll find the site a bit buggy, and lacking in features, but I expect to be adding them fast and furiously in the next few days.  Here's my initial <code>rake stats</code>:

Code LOC: 249
Test LOC: 240
Code to Test Ratio: 1:1.0
