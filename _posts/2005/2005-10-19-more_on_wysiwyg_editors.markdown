title: more on WYSIWYG editors
---
I tried TinyMCE, and got it configured the way I like.  However, I had some serious issues with IE6 and flaky textareas.  I initially thought it was "Prototype":http://prototype.conio.net being rude (overwriting core javascript functions), but Sam said that was not the case as of v0.4.

Anyways, I ditched TinyMCE and just went with "WidgEditor":http://www.themaninblue.com/experiment/widgEditor/.  Ten minutes from download and I had it fully integrated into Cloudnine, my Ruby on Rails publishing framework.

Plea to browser developers: please make this kind of thing integrated.  We spend too much time in a browser window these days, _not_ to have a decent writing environment.  

Back to the trenches...

*Update:*  I did some checking, and it looks like Safari support "may be on the way":http://tinymce.moxiecode.com/punbb/viewtopic.php?id=1560.   I have no clue how long it takes for a webkit nightly to make it onto Tiger desktops around the world, but this is encouraging.
