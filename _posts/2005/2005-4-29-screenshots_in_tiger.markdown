title: screenshots in Tiger
---
I'm a new mac user, but even the thought of "easier screenshots in Tiger":http://arstechnica.com/journals/apple.ars/2005/4/29/142 are appealing.  I find there's a wonderful shortcut that dumps a screenshot to the desktop, but in _PDF_ format.  Huh?   Luckily in Tiger, screenshots are exported as PNGs.  

Still, who can remember <code>command + shift + 3</code>?  _Print Screen_ is so much more natural (though, I'm sure there's a valid reason, for example if the key doesn't exist on Mac keyboards).
