I've been using "FeedBurner":http://feedburner.com to splice my main feed with my "del.icio.us links":http://del.icio.us/technoweenie, but lately it's been down.  That's why you don't see anything on the homepage anymore.

Plus, I know I prefer split feeds to spliced feeds, so I imagine most other people do.  

Some changes to this blog are definitely coming...
