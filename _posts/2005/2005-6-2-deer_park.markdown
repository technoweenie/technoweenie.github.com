I've been trying out the latest Firefox beta browser, "Deer Park":http://www.mozilla.org/projects/firefox/.  It's a drag that most of my extensions don't work.  

The biggest thing I've noticed is the Javascript Console lets me know if it has problems parsing the CSS.  *Very* handy for web developers... and *very* annoying for web developers using CSS hacks...
