title: tail utility for windows
---
When doing any kind of log watching, the unix <code>tail</code> command is very helpful.  Other than the Windows 2003 Resource Kit, or using simple homemade ones (I wrote a basic ruby tail command in about 10-15 lines), there aren't many options for windows users.

I found a "decent GUI tail app":http://www.rhazes.com/cgi-bin/Utilitiy_0.asp.  No installation required.  Just copy tail.exe to your path, and you can type 'tail' from the Run prompt or the command line.

*Update:* "Sanjay":http://sastools.com/b2/ posted a link to another one: "Tail for Win32":http://tailforwin32.sourceforge.net/.  Thanks, this looks even better.
